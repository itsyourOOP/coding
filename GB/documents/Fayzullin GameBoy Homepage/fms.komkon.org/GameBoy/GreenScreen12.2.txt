TGSSZ Walk-Through #1: Final Fantasy Legend

	There are few first-generation GameBoy games I can think of that can
truly be said to have aged well.  Tetris comes to mind, and maybe Super Mario
Land . . . Revenge of the 'Gator (much better than Pinball Dreams) and 
Gargoyle's Quest (better than its NES sequel), perhaps.  And Final Fantasy
Legend.
	Even though it is almost as old as the GB itself, FFL is still one of
the most popular RPGs for the system.  It is also one of the best, surpassed in
depth of play and replay value only by the rest of the GB FF series.  In fact,
FFL is, in some ways, superior to Final Fantasy, the NES game from which it was
derived.  Although I don't have specs to bounce around, FFL plays as if it is
at least as large as FF--or, rather, the FFL universe seems equally vast.  As
well, there are more character-types to choose from (FFL's 8 vs. FF's 6) and
more types of enemies to confront (FFL's 162 + 4 Arch-Fiends, Ashura, and the
Creator vs. FF's 117 + the 4 Fiends and Chaos).
	To be fair, I should point out that FFL certainly has a few flaws:  The
inability to exert real control over the changes in Mutant abilities can be very
frustrating; don't be surprised if a Mutant decides to evolve right when you've
found a set of abilities you really like.  As well, while the towns, worlds,
and battle animations are impressive for a first-generation GB cart, the
intermediate levels of the Tower get pretty tedious to wander through (when
you finally have the chance to acquire the Door, it's a very welcome relief!).
However, Square Soft corrected all of the flaws of FFL in its sequel, FFL2.
	What follows is a fairly in-depth walk-through of FFL.  It contains a
great deal of "spoiler" information, so first-time players should consider
themselves warned!  I have not provided play-control instruction, as the manual
does that rather well.  I have, though, gone into considerable detail in 
explaining the quest in the Base World for the benefit of anyone playing
without a manual.  It's easier to figure out the play-control (which is actually
very intuitive) than to survive a premature trip to the Castle of Sword!
	I certainly hope FF newbies will find this useful, and I welcome
additions and/or corrections from all you FF veterans!
	Enjoy!

Setting up a Party
	For me, one of the biggest advantages of the Final Fantasy Legend series
is the flexibility the games offer for creating parties; FFL3 lost some of that
initial flexibility but made up for it in the expansion of the possibilities for
character transformation.  For a starting party in FFL, I recommend the second
party-type provided in the manual: two Humans and two Mutants.  In fact, I'll
get even more specific: start out with two Human Males (HM1 and HM2 in the walk-
through) and two Mutant Females (MF1 and MF2).  When you've gotten used to the
gameplay and the layout of the first world, you can start playing around with
Monsters as party members; new FFL players might find Monsters, and maybe even
Mutants, a bit frustrating.

Money Can't Buy You Love
	But for Human characters, it does buy level advancement!  In FFL,
Humans do not collect experience points and automatically advance in level.  
You must  buy Strength, Agility, and HP upgrades in order to develop your Human
characters.  Also, I have not found any way to raise the Mana of a Human
character (except for the Game Genie!!!), so don't bother buying spells such as 
Ice, Elec, or Stone for Humans.  Save your cash for HPs! 

Those Pesky Mutants
	As explained in the instruction manual, Mutants acquire spell-like
magic abilities which change as the characters advance in level.  What the
manual doesn't say is that you have very little control over how these abilities
evolve.  There are, though, some principles to bear in mind:  
	1. The more you use the abilities, the more likely they are to change.
	This is kind of a "catch-22" in that if you don't use the abilities,
	they will not improve or strengthen; however, it seems that as soon as
	your Mutant gets a set of abilities you like to use, they change.
	2. The manual says that once Mutants reach a certain level, they
	can no longer use store-bought items.  This is simply not true.
	Mutants always have the option to use armor, weapons, and other items;
	however, the more you use store-bought weapons, the less-likely your
	Mutant abilities are to develop and change.  In fact, if you use
	weapons too often, some of your mutant abilities will spontaneously
	"fizzle out"--they will still be on your Abilities menu, but the
	number of uses will drop to 0 until you visit an Inn.
	3. Mutants are the only characters who can get the most use out of the
	P-Knife, P-Sword, and Vampic ("vampiric") Sword.  The P-Knife and
	P-Sword do damage as a function of the weilder's Mana; Humans don't 
	have any, so they should not use these weapons.  The Vampic Sword does
	damage by absorbing HP from the enemy struck by the sword; these HP
	are added to the weilder's HP, but only if the weilder's HP are not at
	the weilder's current maximum.  If the weilder's HP are at maximum, the
	sword will absorb HP from the enemy but will not pass the HP to the
	weilder.  The absorption power of the Vampic Sword may be linked to
	Mana, since it seems to always absorb 0 HP when weilded by a Human. 

Monsters: They are What They Eat
	As the manual explains, Monsters advance in level/abilities by eating
the Meat of other Monsters; most of the time, this will cause the Monster to
transform into another type of monster, but sometimes all that will happen is
a recharge of HP and abilities.  The _Nintendo GameBoy Players Guide_ includes
a comprehensive "Transformation Table" which will indicate what any given
monster-type will change to when it eats any given type of monster meat.  The
only problem is that the table is not completely correct.  I have used the
table to try to direct quite a few transformations, only to have something
completely different result.  Your best bet is to compile your own table by
keeping track of the changes your Monsters undergo.  Bear in mind that the
transformations are not always upgrades!  It's very depressing to have a
nice hefty Oni eat the wrong meat and end up a Fly.  Bummer.

World One: Continent
	Now that you've got your party sorted out, you're ready to start 
adventuring.  Here's a quick outline of the places you need to go in the order
in which you need to visit them.  The map below provides a general idea of where
each place is located on the overall world map.  You will find that there are 
many obstacles to negotiate between the various locations; terrain will limit
"straight-line" travel.  Similar outlines and maps will be provided for each
world.  In the walk-through, directions will be given as single or paired
letters--N for north, W for west, SE for southeast, etc.

1. The Tower: Base Town
	Once you have organized your party, head out into the great wide-open
and do some exploring.  The Tower sits on an island surrounded by a moat-like
river. I suggest staying on this island and fighting the monsters you encounter
there until you accumulate at least 500 GP.  This will take about fifteen or
twenty battles, since you will only encounter single monsters worth 40 GP each,
and you will need to return to the Inn rather often to replenish your HP.
	A note about using the Inns:  You are charged GP for your stays at the
Inns based on the amount of HP your party members need to regain.  If your
party members still have all their HP, staying at an Inn is free!  Bear in mind 
that staying at an Inn replenishes your HP and recharges your Mutant abilities,
so even though a stay costs no money, your Mutants can still benefit.  You will
find this a very useful thing when one or more of your Mutants gains the Cure
ability; you can use the Mutant's ability to replenish your party's HP, then
stay at an Inn for free to recharge the Cure! 
	Once you've collected the cash, go to the Weapons/Armor shop and buy a
suit of Gold Armor and a set of Gold Gauntlets.  Equip your HM1 with the Gold
Armor and Bronze Gauntlets; equip HM2 with the Gold Gauntlets.  At this point,
your FMs will not need armor as long as they stay in the back of the marching
order.  You're certainly free to wander the island long enough to equip your
whole party with Gold Armor, but what I've suggested is a minimum requirement
for a reasonable chance of survival.
	At this point in the game, you want to do as much fighting as you can
while following this principle:  Make money, don't spend it.  The enemies on
the island are, for the most part, easy to beat.  You will face Goblins,
Albatrosses, Lizards and Zombies, which I've just listed in order from easiest
to hardest to beat.  Because of the relative weakness of the enemies in the
first world, don't waste your money on magic and magic items; you don't
really need them yet.  
	It's possible to rush through the first world fairly quickly, but I
believe that the best style for RPGs like FFL is to move slowly and think
carefully about how you equip and prepare your characters.    More than likely,
if you rush through the first world, you will get killed before you reach the
third floor of the Tower.  It gets really nasty really quickly in there.  
	Remember to check the abilities of your Mutants after each battle.  For
their first few fights, use their Rapiers, but as soon as their mutant abilities
begin to appear, use those abilities as much as possible!  The more you use the
abilities, the more rapid they will change and increase in power; as well, using
the mutant abilities will cause increases in Mana, which will be useful when you
start buying spells for the Mutants.  With careful play, you can increase your
MFs' Mana to 99 before you reach World Two!  

2. Hero
	If you followed the instructions above, you've armored your Humans,
powered-up your mutants, and developed a feel for the battle techniques.  You
are now ready to leave the "sanctuary" of the Tower and have some serious 
adventures.  Your first destination is the Town of Hero, which you will find
to the SE of the tower island.  Cross the bridge and immediately head S until
you hit mountains; go W until the town appears.  You now know the location of
two Inns, so you can run around and kill things to gain GP and experience,
safe in the knowledge that there are nearby places to which you can flee.
	A word of warning:  For now, stay away from the little forest path to
the SW of the tower island; it is a quick route to/from the Castle of Sword,
and if you go there now your entire party will be killed.  
	In Hero, you will learn the story of the naked statue and the items it 
formerly wore.  You must retrieve the three items from the kings who have
"borrowed" them in order to unlock the door at the base of the Tower.  Start
you quest with the Castle of Shield, in the forest directly E of Hero.

3. The Castle of Shield
	The Castle of Shield is not a very hospitable place.  If you try to talk
to the guards, they'll throw you out, and if you avoid them and try to speak to 
the King and his Steward, they'll just be rude.  You cannot get the shield at
this point, so don't wear yourself out trying.  Actually, you can skip both the 
Castle of Shield and the Castle of Armor and go directly to 5 and 6, but you
won't be able to really appreciate the evolution of the story.

4. The Castle of Armor
	The guards are more friendly here, but you still won't come out of your
first visit with anything but information.  See the King and he'll tell you of
his sad romance with a young girl of South Town--which gives you a good reason
to head south.
 
5. South Town
	Here you will learn of Bandit, who lives in a cave to the SW of South
Town.  He has been using threats to prevent the girl from marrying the King of
Armor.  Hmmm . . . maybe you should go and smack him around.  But before you do,
here's some advice:
	Bandit may look like a Lizard, but he is actually one level up.  He's
a P-Frog (as in "poisonous frog") and can be a challenging opponent.  His
biggest threat is his poisonous skin; if he is struck with a handheld weapon,
the poison will carry through the weapon and harm the wielder!  The least
expensive solution is to have all of your characters, or at least the HMs,
purchase Bows; for much more cash, you can equip your MFs with spells like Ice
or Elec (Electricity).  The basic idea here is to use weapons that let you
attack from a distance.

6. Bandit Cave
	Here are directions for a quick trip through the cave:  At the bottom
of the stairs, go W, then follow the passages N, E all the way, then S; turn E,
then take the stairs S.  At the bottom of those stairs is a rather large cave; 
go W to the wall, then follow the wall S to a W turn; at the end of a very
short passageway, you'll  find a door.  Go through the door and go W, then
follow the passageway N to your confrontation with Bandit.  Show no mercy.
	After defeating him, go back to through the door into the large cave.
In the NE corner of the cave is a door which will remain locked until you
defeat Bandit.  Once he's dead, it will unlock, and you can raid the riches
within.  You will find these items in the chests: Potion, Strong, and a Bronze
Shield.  Return to South Town to freshen up at the Inn, then head back to the
Castle of Armor.

7. The Castle of Armor
	Having defeated Bandit, you've earned the eternal gratitude of the lusty
King of Armor.  Of course, he knows that gratitude can't be cashed in for GP, so
he gives you the King Armor, as well his thanks.
	Now . . . here's your first big decision:  What do you do with the
Armor?  Do you take it back to Hero and put it the statue?  Or do you put it
on yourself?  C'mon . . . who's gonna know?
	Equip HM1 with the King Armor and equip HM2 with the Gold Armor from
HM1.  Hey, if the Kings could "borrow" this stuff, so can you.

8. The Castle of Sword
	Although you're welcome to go and ask (and pick up some GP on the way),
the King of Shield is still not ready to part with his Shield, so your next
destination is the Castle of Sword.  However, this is a very dangerous place;
the monsters therein are the most powerful in the first world, and they attack
in groups.  To prepare yourself, go to Hero and buy enough HP200 to boost the
HP of your HMs over 100; if you have the cash, you can give buy some Strong for
them, as well, but that stuff is expensive--and you can beat the King of Sword 
without it!  If you are using your MFs well, their HP and abilities should be
increasing rather nicely; don't forget that Mutant HP and stats increase on
their own--store-bought HP, Strong, and Agility DO NOT work on Mutants!
	When you enter the Castle of Sword, AVOID the guards!  Unlike the guards
in the Castle of Shield, they will attack you, and you will not be able to run
away.  Enter the castle and head straight for stairs.  On the second level, make
your way to the southern stairway; the northern stairway leads to a dead-end,
and the monsters you will likely face on the way will try to make it a one-way 
trip!  The key is to lose as few HP as possible on your way to King Sword.  Find
him, beat him, and get the King Sword.  Once you get the Sword, give it to HM1
and pass whatever weapon he's been using to HM2.  Unlike the weapons you buy,
the King Sword has unlimited uses.  As well, it is the most powerful weapon
available in the first world.  Nifty!
	To complete your ensemble, you will be heading to the Castle of Shield.
But first, stop at an Inn and recover from your experience in Castle Sword.  
Even with the King Armor, it's not a pleasant place . . . but you will be back!

9. The Castle of Shield
	After powdering your nose in the Inn of your choice, head to the Castle
of Shield.  The King is ready to give up his Shield now, mainly 'cause he's
dead.  Pursue the treacherous Steward through the secret door in the N wall of
the  King's chambers and wreak some serious vengeance upon his cowering form.
Then you'll get the King Shield.
	Now, here's a tip:  Don't equip HM1 with the King Shield.  Using a
shield in battle means he cannot attack, and you don't want to lose the power
of the King Sword.  Equip one of the MFs with the King Shield, either the
weakest MF or the one with the fewest defensive mutant abilities.  When used,
the King Shield throws a force field over your ENTIRE party, which makes it
a handy defense, especially since, like the King Sword, it has unlimited uses!

10. Hero
	Okay.  If you want to be a good little adventurer, the thing to do now
is to head to Hero and give back those wonderful toys.  Put them on your Item
list, then go up to the statue; press A twice with the hand on each item and
they will be returned to the statue.
	If you want to make sure that you'll survive the next few floors of the
Tower with relative ease, don't be so hasty!  Instead of heading to Hero, go
back to the Castle of Sword and repeatedly attack one of the Guards.  As a
precaution,  you might first want to buy a Rod and equip one of your MFs with
it to make sure that you can heal any damage your weaker characters might take 
while you are upping your bank balance.
	So how do you know when you've had enough?  Well, here are some goals
to attain before returning the items to the statue:
	1. Raise the HP of your HMs to 200+.  As you'll learn, HP upgrades
	are labelled according to their effectiveness.  HP200 will work until
	your character's HP pass 200; at that point, an effective upgrade can
	only be provided by HP400.  Likewise, HP400 only works until your
	character's HP reach 400, and so on.  You cannot buy HP400 in the first
	world, so you might as well get what you can get while you can get it.
	2. Raise the Strength and Agility of your HMs at least into the teens.
	3. Equip your strongest characters with Axes (probably your HMs) before
	returning the items to the statue.  The Axe is the most powerful
	strength-based handheld weapon which can be purchased in the first
	world.  You'll need them.
	4. Before you return the items to the statue, equip all four of the
	party members with Gold Armor; if you can, equip the HMs with Gold
	Gauntlets, as well (remember that Mutants can only carry four items; if
	you load them with armor, they won't be able to carry weapons and/or
	spells).
	Now . . . return the items to the statue.  As soon as you turn to
leave the pedestal, you will be attacked by Gen-Bu, a long-necked Gamera
lookalike who has a serious problem with adventurers.  But you're ready.

11. The Tower
	After defeating Gen-Bu, you will receive the Black Sphere, which will
unlock the door at the base of the Tower.  Stand in front of the door, choose
Sphere on your Item menu, and press A twice with the hand on the Black Sphere.
The door to the Tower now stands open.

Travelling Up the Tower
	The tower contains over twenty floors separated by a series of stairs.
When you press SELECT, you will see the number of your present floor, as well as
the highest floor you have reached.  The four worlds contained within the tower
are located at 1F, 5F, 10F, and 16F.  The intermediary floors contain mazes of
varying complexity, as well as sub-worlds in which you will find information or
have to perform some small task.  To the left of each stair is a small room, 
some of which will contain chests of items; nearly all will contain some sort of
enemy, either in the room or on the stair itself.  Upon entering the tower, you
will notice that the enemies get really nasty really quickly.  Luckily, you
can move back down the Tower to floors and worlds visited previously if you need
to get an Inn, Shop, or House of Life.  As well, you will occasionally come 
across small pools of healing water which will recover HP, but will not
replenish Mutant abilities; only a stay at an Inn will do that.

Intermediary Floors: 2-4
	Stair 1:	No item.
	2F:		Head S, W, N, then through the door.
	Stair 2:	No item.
	3F:		Head W and you'll find a door to a false Paradise.  Your
		        other option is to head W, N, W, then through the door.
	Stair 3:	No item.
	4F: 		Head N, then W to the second pair of N/S stairways, then
			S and through the door; you'll end up in a sort of
			Purgatory-like place.  Talk to all the characters EXCEPT
			the gargoyles, unless you're in the mood for a fight.
			Don't spent too much time here because, as you walk
			through the place, you take damage from the "spiked" 
			floor!  Luckily, N of this nasty place you will find a
			helpful Healing Pool.
			Your other option when you enter this floor is to head
			N, W to the second pair of N/S stairways, then N and
			through the door.
	Stair 4:	The chest contains a Colt.
	5F:		In the SW corner of this floor, you will find another
			Healing Pool; in the NW corner, you will find the door
			to World Two.  In the center of this floor is a door
			which you will not be able to unlock until you find the
			Blue Sphere.  Take note of the "Guy With the Hat" who
			stands just S of the door to Ocean.  Heed his words now,
			and expect to meet him again.

1. Tower Island Town
	When you enter Ocean from the Tower, you will find yourself on the
largest of this world's islands; your first destination is a town located in
the SE corner of the island.  If you talk to everyone, you will learn of the
next two destinations in your tour of the world of Ocean, and you will also
learn of the means of travel that will get you there.
	Pirates have made travel by ship quite dangerous, so instead of a ship,
you must seek out a mysterious floating island--which gets attacked, anyway,
even though it isn't a ship.  Go figure.  Before you try looking for it, though,
hit the local shops and get yourself ready for adventure!

A Few Words About Weapons
	In case you haven't noticed by now, certain weapons are best-weilded by
certain types of characters.  For example, the P-Knife, P-Sword, and Vampic
Sword should be reserved for use by Mutants.  But it actually gets more
complicated than that.
	As previously suggested, most weapons do damage as a function of the
weilder's Strength, Agility, or Mana.  All Sword damage (with the exception of
the P-Sword) is based on Strength, for example, as is the damage done by the
Hammer, Axe and Rock.  Agility determines the damage inflicted by the Rapier,
Saber, L-Saber, and Catcraw.  With some weapons, however, damage does not seem to
be based on abilities, but the weilder's chance of successfully hitting an enemy
is.  This seems true of firearms such as the Colt and Musket, as well as all
Bows.
	Also, it seems that Mutant Strength and Agility can be affected by the
successful use of weapons which depend on those abilities.  For example, if a
Mutant frequently uses a Rapier, the Mutant's Agility will increase; if a Mutant
frequently uses a Sword, the Mutant's Strength will increase.  Don't forget,
though, that use of store-bought weapons will hinder the development of Mutant
special abilities.
	While on the surface of Ocean, your weapons of choice should be the
Katana for strong characters and the Saber for agile characters.  You will find
that the Coral Sword, apparently the strongest sword in world one, is available 
in the Weapons/Armor shop in the Undersea Town, but you don't really need it. 
This weapon is particularly effective against sea creatures, but, surprisingly,
it is not really necessary in Ocean.  If your sword-weilding characters have 20+
Strength or so, you'll get by just fine with a Katana or even a Battle Sword.
The Coral Sword is far too expensive for me to really recommend it.  Buy one
and play around with it if you have the cash, but I wouldn't waste money that
could otherwise be spent on ability upgrades!

2. Island Tunnels
	North of Port Town you will see a cave entrance.  This takes you into
a network of tunnels which link a group of islands near the center of the Ocean
world.  The Floating Island is located offshore of one of the islands.  To get
to it quickly, follow these directions:
	1. Enter the cave N of Port Town
	2. Go E and turn N, then head E at the 4-way intersection.
	3. Keep going E; pass-by the stairway an take the N turn.
	4. Exit up the stairs at the point where the N path turns E.
	5. You are now at point 2b1.  Enter the cave at the NE corner of
	the island (2b2).
	6. Head W to the N turn; go N to the E turn; head E as far as you can
	go (there will be a tiny jog S at the halfway point).
	7. Turn N and continue to the E turn and exit up the stairs.
	8. You are now at point 2c.  The Floating Island is the northernmost
	island on the W coast.  Now you can travel freely almost anywhere in the
	Ocean world.  Feel free to explore, although your next destination is
	in the far NE corner of the world.
	While in the tunnels, you will often encounter Pirates, sometimes with
other types of enemies.  When you find yourself facing Pirates, try to direct
your attacks such that you kill the Pirates as soon as possible.  Pirates will
steal your GP during the battle; you will not recover the stolen gold, even if
you win the battle.  Also, when you face Magicians, try to wipe them out with
magic spells launched by high-Mana characters; Magicians can cure themselves,
so damage that is not instantly fatal can sometimes be removed in the next round
of battle!

3. Northeast Island Town
	Here you will learn more of the dragon brothers and the mysterious Old
Man.  To find the geezer, sail the Floating Island directly S of East Island
Village.

4. The Old Man's Island
	You will have to travel through a bit of a maze to get to the Old Man.
Go around the table in the center of the maze, but avoid the small patch of
stony ground just before you reach the Old Man; if you step onto it, it will 
"teleport" you back to the Floating Island.  The Old Man will tell you of the
Airseed, which is not really as well-hidden as he'd like you to think.  Just
sail the Floating Island directly S of South Island.

5. Palm Tree Island
	You'll arrive here.  Position your lead character so that he is 
standing just to the S of the palm tree in the center of the island; approach
the tree from the S so that he ends up facing N.  Press A and you should
receive the Airseed--as long as your Item list isn't full!  Remember to have a 
slot for it when you get to the tree!  If you prefer, you can float on back to 
the Old Man and let him tell you more about the Airseed.  Or you can just keep 
reading.  You do not need to do anything with the Airseed; just leave it on your
Item list.  You do not have to Equip any character with it, nor do you have to 
press any buttons or anything.  When the time comes to use it, it'll simply
work by itself.  If you should happen to accidentally drop it in your Trash or 
get cocky and sell it, you can just head right back to Palm Tree Island and
pick another one.  What's it do?  Well . . . head to the NW corner of the world
and you'll find out.

Keep Up With the Joneses, or They'll Kill You
	No doubt it's occurred to you that, as your party advances through the
game, the enemies you encounter get tougher.  More or less, the monsters
increase in level everytime you move to a new major area of the game.  For
example, when you leave Continent and enter the Tower, the enemies get tougher;
as you advance through the next four floors, the enemies get tougher, and when
you enter Ocean, the enemies get tougher again.  When you move from Tower
Island into the tunnels, the enemies get tougher, and when you start cruising
the sea, the enemies get tougher.  And when you enter the whirlpool and start
wandering the sea floor . . . guess what . . . tougher enemies.  It's a good
idea to upgrade your HMs Strength, Agility, and HP as you move through the
different areas in order to keep up with the monsters!
	Now's a good time to start thinking about the "Do the Math" rule of
level upgrading.  There are four major worlds before you hit the bigtime at the
top of the Tower.  So, divide the maximum you can attain in each of your
character abilities by four and you'll get a goal to try and attain (when
possible) by the end of each world.  If you round up a tad, the figures come
out to +25 for Strength, Agility and Mana, and +250 for HP.  With HP,
your HMs are a bit restricted by what you can purchase: you can't buy HP400
until Ocean, so you should try to leave Continent with 203 HP; you can't buy
HP600 until you reach The Ruins, but you should be okay with the 403 HP you can
get by the end of Ocean.  It's fairly easy to accumulate enough cash to match
the +25 rule in Strength and Agility, though.  As for Mutants, just keep using
them, and you'll be surprised at how fast their HP will build, as well as how
quickly Mana and Agility can increase (it's actually possible to get them both
to 99 before leaving Ocean).
	As for Defense, I suggest equipping your HMs with Silver Helms, Armor
and Gauntlets and your MFs with Silver Gauntlets and Armor as soon as you can,
preferably before entering the Undersea Castle.  You can't buy Silver Gauntlets
until you reach the Undersea Town, but you can buy the Armor and Helms in the
Northeast Island Town.  If you want to be economical, you only need to buy
three suits of Silver Armor before entering the Undersea Castle; as noted below,
you will find a suit of Silver Armor in the Castle.

6. The Whirlpool
	Near the NW corner of the world, you will find a small whirlpool.  If
you try to enter it without the Airseed, you will be transported to the bottom
of the ocean, but you'll immediately come back up again, screaming, "I can't
breathe!"  The Airseed produces air from water and will allow you to explore the
area of the world beneath the sea.  So go get it.
	Got it?
	Good.

7. Undersea Town
	After you are flushed down the Whirlpool, you will find that the Airseed
has given you the ability to wander around on the floor of the ocean without
drowning (or being crushed by the incredible pressure of all that water . . .
but let's not get technical).  Follow the E edge of the land S, then turn E
when it does; keep travelling E and you will find the Undersea Town.
	Here you will learn four important pieces of information which almost-
but-not-quite give you a clear sense of the next few things to do.  The whole
"dragon brother" thing has, so far, been a bit confusing.  First you were told
that the brothers live on the NE island, then we find out that Sei-Ryu, the Blue
Dragon, lives in an Undersea Castle and that Ryu-O, whom he has banished, is
actually the King of Dragons.  Once we get underwater, we find out that Ryu-O
is actually still somewhere on the surface and that Sei-Ryu has this thing
about a Red Orb.  Why does the Blue Dragon want the Red Orb?  What's any of that
have to do with Ryu-O?  I wonder if something wasn't lost in the translation.
Anyway, you might as well go see Sei-Ryu.

8. Undersea Castle
	If you travel due S of the Undersea town, you will soon see the entrance
to a stairway come into view in the lower-left of the screen.  This takes you
into a fairly simple tunnel system that leads to another undersea land mass.  To
keep the trip short and sweet, follow these directions:
	1. Head E at the bottom of the stairs until you reach a branch that 
	goes S.
	2. Follow the S branch and take its E turn, then head S again, then W to
	another stairway.
	3. Head W at the bottom of the stairs and count to the 4th N branch; it
	will take you to the other land mass.  The 7th N branch takes you to
	an area that seems covered in some sort of sandstorm.  It's a good place
	to wander around and kill things, but I have found no items there.
Head directly S when you exit the stair and you will see the Undersea Castle
come into view to your right.
	Like the Castle of Armor, the Undersea Castle is full of guards (octupi,
actually) which don't go away when killed.  Unless you're in the mood for a
fight, avoid them as you move through the floors of the castle; this will, at
times, require that you wait for them to move out of your way.
	Floor 1:Head E immediately, then continue N past the stairway (don't
		enter it yet).  Work your way to the NE area of the floor and
		enter the door.  At the end of the hallway is a chest that
		contains the Bluekey, which is essential to getting through the
		Castle.  Now head back to the stairway and go up.
	Floor 2:Work your way counterclockwise to the stairs in the SE corner.
		Ignore the door in the NW corner; it's an empty room.
	Floor 3:Work your way to the door in the NE corner, and you'll be
		rewarded with Silver Armor, a Cure spell, and a handy Grenade.
		Now follow the paths to the stairs in the SW corner.
	Floor 4:Travel clockwise around the floor to the door.
	Floor 5:As you travel N, take a good look at the two rows of orbs you
		will pass, but don't try to pick up any of them.  Continue N
		and you will arrive in a room full of orbs.  Now is the time to
		apply some info given to you earlier by a townsperson:
		"Remember where the two lines cross."  If you want to figure to
		figure out the meaning on your own, stop reading.  If not . . .
		study the chart below.  The 0s are orbs; the x is the one you
		want, and the ^ indicates where you need to stand and which
		direction to face in order to pick it up.  Press the A button
		and deal with it!

		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 x 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 ^ 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

	Yes, you've found the Red Orb, and now you must face the wrath of
Sei-Ryu.  But if you prepared well, it will be a brief and rewarding battle.
With Orb in hand, you can now return to the surface and figure out what to do
with it.  Although the text as translated for the English-language version of
FFL doesn't make it perfectly clear, the place to go now is back to the Old Man.

9. The Old Man's Island
	This time, when you visit the Old Man, he will present you with this 
riddle: "What can you get for 2 Longswords, 3 Gold Helms, and 4 Potions?"  The
answer can be found by pricing the items and buying the single item available
for a price equalling their total, as below:
	Longsword       2 x 132 GP = 264 GP
	Gold Helm       3 x 164 GP = 525 GP
	Potion          4 x  50 GP = 200 GP
        Total:                       989 GP = Battlesword
Buy one in Northeast Island Town and take it to the Old Man; note that if,
after receiving the riddle, you go and see him without a Battlesword, he'll
smite you mightily and will actually cause damage!  The misers among you will
appreciate the fact that he does not take the weapon; you get to keep it, and
he'll even accept one that has been used.  In return for simply showing him the
Battlesword, thus proving you can add, he gives you the Blue Orb.  Being able
to add is actually quite important, in a way, since you must "add" the two Orbs
in order to produce the Blue Sphere:  Put both Orbs in your Item menu, then
double-click the A button with the hand on one Orb and repeat with the other
Orb.  If you do this correctly, you will receive the Blue Sphere, which will 
unlock the door into the next floor of the Tower.

10. The Tower
	At this point, you have accomplished the tasks necessary to leave Ocean.
It wasn't the most clearly explained of quests (I suppose you knew all along
that the Old Man was really Ryu-O, right?  Sure.), but it did get you the next
Sphere.  If you feel you're ready, you can re-enter the Tower and advance to 
the next floor.
	However, if you want to ensure that, once you get to the next world,
you can rapidly equip your party with the most effective weapons, armor, and
items available, you might want to take a quick trip down the Whirlpool again.
If you followed the "Do the Math" rule, your characters are now as advanced as
you can get them with respect to items and abilities--that is, if you could
afford it.  To get the cash to max-out your stats and/or to be able to afford
"the good stuff" when you hit the next world, try this money-making technique.
	Equip your HMs with fresh weapons--Katanas are nice; either equip your
MFs with fresh Sabers or try to make sure they have fully-charged ESP as a
mutant ability.  Ride the Whirlpool again and head to the Undersea Castle.  As
in the Castle of Armor, you can repeatedly attack the guards at will; however,
you can make more money even faster if you head back to one of the orb rooms
and repeatedly attack the same orb over and over.  If your HMs are strong
enough, you can kill an Atom Crab with a single blow, picking up an easy 400 GP
each time!  When you've gotten about 70,000 GP hoarded away, which is not as
difficult as it may seem, return to the surface and max-out your stats; if you
are ready to move on, just take your cash (AT LEAST 60,000 GP) and head for the
Tower.

Intermediary Floors: 6-9
	Stair 5:	No item.
	6F:		Head E, S, then W to the door.
	Stair 6:	No items.
	7F:		Take either of the stairs N and you'll find a door
			leading to a small water-filled floor.  "Swim" N to the
			row of fish statues.  Stand ON the first statue and
			press A for a little message; stand on the second statue
			and press A three times to receive three X-Potions (if
			press over and above three will result in a battle);
			stand on the sixth statue and press A to receive another
			little message.  Re-enter the Tower and head S as far as
			you can go, then W and N to the door.
	Stair 7:	The chest contains a Musket.
	8F:		Head E into the room.  In the NE corner is a Healing
			Pool, just in case you need it.  At the top of the
			stairway in the NW corner is another pool, but it is a
			fake.  Continue E, then S to the SECOND E corridor,
			where you will find the next door.
	Stair 8:	No item.
	9F:		Head W, then N and up the short stairway.  The door 
			leads to a sort of "clinic" in which you'll find a
			House of Life (SW corner) and a place to refresh your
			HP and Mutant abilities (SE corner).  Most of the
			bed-ridden adventurers are comatose, but the gargolye
			in the NW corner will tell you something of interest.
			When you leave the clinic, head S down the same 
			stairway and continue S until you must turn W; head W to
			the N turn, then continue E, N, and W to the door.
	Stair 9:	The chest contains a P-Knife.
	10F:		Head S past the fish statues, then follow the S border
			to the E.  Talk to the lil' dude you'll see as you move
			E; his advice is important!  Continue E through the
			short narrow corridor, then turn N and head up the
			stairway.  You now stand before the door to the World of
			Sky!  Ooooh . . . feel the chills?

1. Sky Town
	Ah, espionage!  Such fun!  In Sky Town, you will learn of the evil
fiend Byak-Ko, who rules Sky with an iron . . . uh, paw, I guess.  He has all
but crushed the small resistance movement that rose up against him, and he
now searches for the daughters of Charles, the former rebel leader, who hold
the secret to the White Sphere.  Byak-Ko needs guards, as do most evil dictators
against whom resistance movements have risen; perhaps you can infiltrate his
Flying Castle by joining his forces.  Of course, you do this purely out of
altruism; it's not like you're looking for a White Sphere or anything, right?
	Wander Sky Town and talk to everyone, but DON'T enter the Pub yet!
First, you need to spend spend some of that cash.  Enter the Weapons/Armor
Shop and buy Dragon Armor for everyone in your party.  By the way, you can
chuck the Airseed and Bluekey, if you haven't done so by now--and make sure
you sell your old armor!  The armor will cost about 34,000 GP in total; buy 
other weapons if you'd like (there are lots of fun things available here), but
bear in mind that you will need another 13,000 GP for your next major purchases,
which you'll be making after a certain job interview.
	Head to the Pub with your snazzy new armor and strike up a conversation.
Then strike the guards that attack you!  After this brief "test," you'll be sent
to see Byak-Ko . . . if you live.

2. The Floating Castle (FC1)
	After Byak-Ko hires you, he gives you your first assignment:  Find
Charles's daughter, Jeanne, and bring her to him.  He'll get rude when pressed 
for more information, but, hey, he's an arch-fiend; what did you expect?  You
will then be sent to a waiting Glider, which will enable you to fly from cloud
to cloud in Sky.

3. Hidden Town 
	Now, you can do this the hard way or the easy way.  The hard way is to 
start wandering aimlessly around Sky and hope to find the Rebel Base.  Here's
the easy way:
	After leaving the Floating Castle, fly E until you reach the square of 
trees surrounding the Tower.  Position the Glider at the NE corner of the square
and fly N until you come to a small square of cloud.  Land on it and move about
a bit until you discover the Hidden Town.
	Talk your way across Hidden Town and you will learn about the connection
between Charles's daughters and the White Sphere.  Then go to the Weapons/Armor
Shop and buy a set of Giant Gauntlets for HM1; you can buy one for HM2 as well, 
but bear in mind that you'll be able to pick up a set for free quite soon.  When
you're ready to leave Hidden Town, fly S back to the Tower.

4. The Rebel Base
	Head W back to the Floating Castle.  Position your Glider on the NE
corner of the cloud on which the Castle sits.  Fly N and you will end up tucked
neatly between some trees just S of the Rebel Base.  Leave the Glider and enter 
the Base.  At this point, the game's programming will supply ethics and honor to
players who might not have any.  You WILL fight against Byak-Ko's soldiers to 
rescue, rather than abduct, Jeanne.  After the fight, she will beg you to find
her sister, Mileille, who is being held in the Flying Castle; you will, of
course, agree.

A Cash Flow Statement
	I suggested leaving Ocean with at least 60,000 GP.  By the time you
reach Sky and start exploring it, you should have been able to increase your
stash to about 70,000 GP.  Here's a budget based on your recent and future
purchases:
		34,000 GP	Dragon Armor
		 5,000 GP	Giant Gauntlets
		 7,500 GP	HM Abilities
		28,500 GP	Weapons, Spells, and Miscellaneous Items

		70,000 GP	Total
	If you haven't already done so, now is a good opportunity to spend
that 7,500 to boost your HMs' Strength and Agility in accordance with the "Do
the Math" guidelines.  As well, you'll have some cash for other toys.  Rune
Swords are handy, particularly since they can deflect magical attacks when used
in battle.  Note that, as explained below, you'll soon be acquiring some weapons
and items as you explore, so you can plan your purchases accordingly.

5. The Floating Castle (FC1)
	The Floating Castle is not doing much floating, yet; you will find it
right where you left it, to the W of Sky Town.  When you leave the Glider port,
you will find yourself on the Castle's lowest floor.
	Although the Floating Castle looks complex and intimidating, it is
actually very easy to travel through.  There is one way in and one way out of
each level, and, while you may seem at times to change direction, you will
always be travelling in a neat linear path (either toward the top or bottom,
depending on where you started).
	You will notice that the Floating Castle is full of Guards.  On this
trip, they will be friendly and helpful--after all, you are working for Byak-Ko,
and he is expecting you.  Follow their instructions to reach Byak-Ko on the 7th
floor.  On the 6th floor, you will actually get a choice of path: a stairway or
a door.  Pick the door, since behind it is a key which you would have to come
back for had you gone up the stairway first.  When you reach the 7th floor, head
E to find the stairway to the chamber where Mileille is being held.

6. Jail
	Well . . . that wasn't very nice.  Betrayal, treachery, and
imprisonment.  That's what you get for trying to help.  But all is not lost!
	So Byak-Ko tosses you in jail with some other losers.  No problem.
Talk to them.  There's a Glider nearby; you just have to get to it.  So that
other wimp can't bend the bars; now's your chance to show him what a REAL 
adventurer is made of.  A few presses on the A button and you're outta there!
Pass by the next cell to the E; you can't talk to or free the prisoners;
however, check out the sword in the next cell.  Head up the N corridor and fight
the Imp for access to the stairs.  If you head E at the top of the stairs,
you'll see a doorway; it's locked, but don't forget about it!  For now, head
W, N, E, N, then W and up the stairway.  Enter the door in the NW corner of the
room at the top of the stairs; head N, then E past the door.  Fight a guard for
access to the chest, in which you'll find the Jailkey.
	DON'T go through the door in this room yet!  Instead, head back down to
the locked door which you noted but left behind.  With the Jailkey, you can
enter the room to find a L-Saber, Giant Gauntlets, and a Death spell.  Now
head back up to the room in which you found the key and use it on the door;
enter the Glider hangar and take the Glider on the lower right.

7. The Rebel Base
	The Jail is located on a cloud W of the original site of the Floating
Castle.  But the Castle has floated!  It is now hovering outside the Rebel
Base, so follow the previous instructions and fly there.
	What the story wants you to do is this:
	1. Enter the Base and find it empty.
	2. Enter the Floating Castle and make your way to Byak-Ko's penthouse;
	this time, though, you're a criminal, so the Guards will attack you
	every chance they get.
	3. Find the penthouse empty and head back down to the Rebel Base.
	4. Discover that the Base has been destroyed.
	5. Search the empty clearing and encounter Byak-Ko.
You can do it that way if you wish, but if you don't feel like battling Guards,
here's an alternative which makes it a lot easier:
	1. Enter the Floating Castle instead of the empty Base.
	2. Exit the Castle immediately and you will find the Base gone.
	3. Search the clearing and confront Byak-Ko.
Now you will learn the depth of Byak-Ko's treachery.  Having manipulated
Mileille into betraying her sister and the rebellion, he chooses to destroy
her.  Instead, Jeanne blocks the fatal blow . . . and you respond with 
avenging rage!
	After you defeat Byak-Ko, this sad melodrama will play itself out.  The
bottom line?  You get the White Sphere.

8. The Tower
	Well, the fat lady has sung in Sky; your work is done here.  Unlike
Continent and Ocean, Sky is a boring place to hang out once you've acquired the
Sphere.  After defeating Byak-Ko, you will no longer have access to either the
Floating Castle or Hidden Town, which means that if you missed any items or
purchases from these locations, you are SOL.  Might as well pop into Sky Town
for some R&R and last-minute shopping, then head into the Tower and use the
White Sphere to unlock the next door.

Intermediary Floors: 11-15
	Stair 10:	No item.
	11F:		If you need it, there is a Healing Pool in the NW
			corner of this area; if not, head S, W, then doen the
			stairs.  Go W, then N, up the stairs, and through the
			door.
	Stair 11:	No item.
	12F:		To quickly exit this floor, head E, N, E, and up the
			stairs.  If you're in the mood for some fighting and
			would like to pick up a Vampic Sword, follow these
			directions when you enter the floor: head S, E, and
			down the stairs; go through the door which will come
			into view to the W and you will find yourself on a
			large cloud.  To the SE of the Tower is a chest which
			contains a Vampic Sword; however, a number of invisible
			"force fields" will prevent you from getting to it by
			the most direct route.  Try heading E to the edge of
			the cloud, then S a screen or so, then W to about the
			center of the cloud, then N to the chest.  Many nasty
			beasties will attack you as you search for the chest, so
			if you don't desperately need the sword, don't bother!
			Note that the Healing Pool S of the exit is fake.
	Stair 12:	The chest contains a Saw.  This is actually a CHAINsaw,
			and it is about as effective as one.  It is very
			difficult to weild and will miss about 50% of the time;
			however, when it connects, it is fatal.  
	13F:		Head E to the 3rd fish statue, then N up the stairs.
			On the other side of the door you will find a dried-out
			world full of depressed, thirsty octupi.  Re-enter the
			Tower and exit the floor through the door to the N of
			the first fish statue.
	Stair 13:	The chest contains an Army Helm.  Equip one of your HMs
			with this.
	14F:		Head E and S to find yet another Healing Pool which does
			not seem to work.  Go back to the door and head W, then
			S to the stairs and through the door that appears in the
			SE; you are now in a flooded world full of frightened
			people.  Of course, it's all Bob's fault; pull the
			garbage out of the drain (which looks like a whirlpool)
			to teach these people a useful ecological message.  As
			the water rushed through the drain, you will be washed
			down with it and wind up back with the octupi, who are
			now joyously wet.  Head back up the Tower to 14F and
			you'll find that it is now a lush forest world full of
			playful, joyous people.  Their little  "game" will give
			you more info on the hierarchy of Ashura and his four
			fiends.  Enter the Castle to the S of the Tower to
			receive your reward for being environmentally friendly:
			a P-Sword, Elixir, X-Potion, and Revive.  You can leave
			the other stuff if you don't want it, but DON'T leave
			the Revive!  Re-enter the Tower and head W, N, W, S, and
			W to the door.
	Stair 14:	No item.
	15F:		There is a working Healing Pool on this floor, but it is
			surrounded by damaging spikes which make it not quite
			worth the effort; to get to it, go E, N up the stairs,
			E, S all the way, then W.  To simply get through the
			head E, then N up the stairs to the door.
	Stair 15:	No item.
	16F:		The first thing to do when you enter this floor is to 
			talk to the guy who stands S of the door.  Hmmm . . . he
			looks familiar, doesn't he?  He's given you some good
			advice before, and now is no exception.  If you wander
			around a bit and return to this spot, he will be gone;
			if you wander without talking to him first, you'll miss
			some important info about Su-Zaku the Red Bird, the last
			of the four fiends.  Now enter the door directly E of
			the door to the Tower and you will arrive in the fourth 
			world, The Ruins.

1. Subway Tunnels: T1-T2
	It's very likely that almost as soon as you stepped from the Tower,
you were attacked by Su-Zaku; if you tried to fight, you probably learned that
nothing available to you right now can damage him--at least not permanently.
Su-Zaku can actually be defeated in battle outside of his lair; for example, if
your MFs have Vampic Swords and are wearing Dragon Armor, they can make short
work of the Red Bird.  However, look closely at the graphic of Su-Zaku; it seems
to be made of flame.  Hmmm . . . a Red Bird made of flame; sounds a bit like the
mythical phoenix, doesn't it?  In fact, if you can do about 2500 HP of damage to
Su-Zaku, it will, as the text states, "go to pieces."  But like the phoenix,
Su-Zaku will be reborn and attack you again, probably as soon as you start to
move.  At this point, it's best to heed the advice of the mysterious stranger
and try to run each time the Red Bird appears.  If you travel the surface on
foot, Su-Zaku will attack you every two or three steps you take; the safest way
to travel at this stage of the game is to use the Subway Tunnels, which connect
most of your destinations in The Ruins.  They're a bit labyrinthine, but being
lost is better than being dead.
	Tunnel 1 (T1) will take you to T2, which is directly east of your first
destination, the Southwest Town.  When you enter T1, a young woman will call to
you and tell you to follow her.  You will almost immediately lose sight of her,
but keep moving W and you'll eventually catch up.  When you find her, she will
need some help and will thank you by telling you of the town nearby.  Head W,
then up the stairs to exit at T2, within sight of the town.

2. Southwest Town
	If you move a bit N when you enter Southwest Town, you will see two 
doors; the western door takes you into an Inn, while the eastern door leads to
a two-story building; there's a Guild on the ground floor, plus a Weapons/Armor
Shop and a Magic/Item Shop on the upper floor.  Since you probably have a pile
of GP saved up by now, take a moment and equip all of your party members with
Army Helms and Suit Armor; these defensive items will be very useful during
those surprise attacks from Su-Zaku (remember that the previous worlds are
still accessible, so if you need GP badly, you can always head back to the orb 
rooms in Ocean, for example, to make some easy cash).  Now go mingle with the
townfolk--don't forget to talk to the gargoyles in the NW part of town!
	Since you were told not to go to the pub, it is, of course, your next
destination; it's the building with the "bike" in front of it.  In the Pub, you
will come very close to getting into a fight, but the woman from the tunnels
will intervene.  You will all become good buddies and develop a plan for the
destruction of Su-Zaku.  Don't leave the Pub after So-Cho lets you use his bike;
instead, talk to him and Sayaka again and you'll receive addional information
about the Library and Ameyoko; talk to one of the gang members, as well, and
you'll find out why you need the bike.

3. Subway Tunnels: T3-T4, T5-T6
	Hop on the bike, leave Southwest Town, and enter T3, located to the NE
of the town; you will exit at T4.  Enter T5, just SE of T4, and you will exit at
T6, W of the Library.  If you wish, you can travel above ground with the bike;
however, Su-Zaku will still be a pest.  Even though monsters attack you in the
tunnels, they are a better way to travel (and earn GP) than the surface, unless
you are in a big hurry.

4. The Library
	In the Southwest Town, you can actually ride the bike into some of the
buildings and up the stairs.  To enter the library, though, you must park the
bike and travel on foot.  Although you can search the entire Library manually,
it's easiest to go directly to the second floor and initate an automatic search
by standing to the NE of the first bookshelf.  If you do this correctly, your
party will travel directly to the location of info on Akiba, the hidden town;
as a bonus, if you move S one row and travel to the 7th shelf from the W (which
is directly below the shelf on which you found info on Akiba), you will receive
a Stone spell.  There is nothing to find on the first floor, so you can leave
after finding the info and spell.

5. Akiba
	The "14N+15E" directions found in the Library are only useful if you
start counting from the correct location.  To get to Akiba with a little less
frustration, try this:
	1. Take T7 to T8, or simply ride the bike there.
	2. Position yourself just to the E of T8 and travel N until you come to
	a 3-column x4-row group of those structures that resemble water tanks.
	3. Position the bike in the center column and travel N; this will get
	you to Akiba with relative ease.
Once in Akiba, you don't have to leave the bike except to pick up items.  You
will find four doors, each leading to a room containing a chest.  Here's what
you'll find in each room:
	SE Room:	The Rom
	SW Room:	Revive
	NW Room:	X-Potion
	 E Room:	Catcraw
You MUST take the Rom, but the other items are optional.
	Now it's time to head to Ameyoko.  You can get there quickly by heading
N after leaving Akiba.

6. Ameyoko
	Ameyoko is basically a shopping mall, and like most malls, you have to
leave your vehicle in the parking lot.  When you first enter Ameyoko, you will 
find the shops laid out as shown below:

                                              G
                                              ^
                                              ^
                        > > > > > > > > > > > ^
          * * * * * * * ^ * * * * * * * * * * *
          *     *     *     *     *     *     *
          *  A  *     *  C  *     *  E  *     *
          *     *     *     *     *     *     *
   Enter >
          *     *     *     *     *     *     *
          *     *  B  *     *  D  *     *  F  *
          *     *     *     *     *     *     *
          * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

		A: Ability upgrades
		B: Weapons, armor, spells
		C: House of Life
		D: Inn
		E: Guild
		F: Miscellaneous stuff
		G: Boards R Us
	If you come here before getting the Rom from Akiba, you will not be
able to get a Board.  Get the Rom first!  Once you've received the appropriate
Board, you can leave.  However, this is an excellent opportunity to power-up
your HMs, since you can purchase HP600 at Shop A.  The next task in this world
is fraught with danger, so boosting you HMs' abilities is a good idea; it's an
expensive idea, too, but, luckily, there is a cash source nearby.  Leave Ameyoko
and enter T10; if you wander around this platform enough, you will eventually be
attacked.  Depending on the type of attacker, you will be able to make between
1600 and 3200 GP per battle; if you run low on weaponry or HP, you can simply 
leave the tunnel and enter Ameyoko again.  When you've acquired enough GP to
make you happy, leave the tunnel, enter Ameyoko, and shop 'til you drop.
	Here's a weird thing to note about Ameyoko: if you enter Ameyoko and 
walk all the way to the E end without buying anything and then turn around and
walk back to the W entrance, the cashier in Shop A will be "out to lunch."  Not
to worry, though.  If you leave the town and then re-enter, he will be back.

7. Subway Tunnels: T10- . . . -T3
	Just follow the tunnels back to Southwest Town, unless you actually
enjoy fleeing from Su-Zaku.

8. Southwest Town
	Head directly to the Pub and talk to So-Cho.  The next morning, you will
try to sneak out to search for the plutonium on your own, but So-Cho and Sayaka
will not let you risk your life alone.  How quaint.

9. Secret Tunnel
	You will then find yourself standing to the W of the entrance to the
Secret Tunnel leading into the Atomic Power Plant.  Hop on your bike and enter
the tunnel, then follow the other bike.  Whenever the lead bike stops, exit your
bike and talk to So-Cho.  When you reach the Sewer, So-Cho and the others will
wait at the entrance while you continue on your own.

10. Sewer
	After talking to So-Cho, head E, S, E, S, then W until you reach the
stairway into the Atomic Power Plant.

11. Atomic Power Plant
	When you exit the stairs, you will be outside the Power Plant.  Travel
counterclockwise along the perimeter of the building; stay on the gray areas and
hug the side of the building; if you step onto the black area, you will end up
in the Sewer again!  Enter the stairway at the S of the building.
	Once again, travel counterclockwise when you exit the stairs.  You must
leave the bike for a brief battle with an Evil Eye; after defeating it, you can
get back on the bike and continue onward to the SW stairway.
	At this point, travel clockwise after exiting the stairs.  So-Cho will
arrive and sacrifice his life so that you can travel further into the Plant.  Be
sure to have an open slot on your Item menu because he will give you a Band Helm
just before he dies; if you don't have an open slot and don't have an item you
wish to trash, make sure to unequip a Helm before you talk to him.
	Through the door So-Cho has made accessible you will find the reactor
core.  Head N and pick up the Plutonium ion the center of the room.  You will
then assemble Erase 99.  Take note of this little trick: ordinarily, you would
need a slot in you Item menu for the Plutonium; however, you can actually pick
up the Plutonium with a full Item menu if you make sure to keep the Rom and
Board in your Item menu rather than equipping a character with them (which is
pointless, anyway); when you try to pick up the Plutonium, the screen will tell
you that you are overloaded and ask you to drop an item; you can now drop either
the Rom or the Board and still complete Erase 99!

12. Southwest Town
	After completing Erase 99, you will find yourself back at the Southwest
Town in the wke of an attack by Su-Zaku.  The town is now littered with corpses,
and all shops except for the Inn will be shut down.  Enter the Pub and talk to
Zoku; he will tell you that Sayaka is in the Skyscraper, your next destination.
If you need to power-up or buy more weaponry, you will have to travel NE to
Ameyoko.  You can now travel the surface without being attacked by Su-Zaku, but
many other monsters will be roaming about outside the tunnels.  Although you can
walk, take the bike outside of the Pub for rapid travel.

13. Skyscraper
	Exit the Southwest Town and travel N until you reach a patch of crater-
covered land.  Travel W along the S edge of the patch and position your bike
below the 3rd crater from the W corner.  Exit the bike and walk N and you will
reach the Skyscraper.  Make sure you're prepared, because this is a dangerous
and complex section of the game--dangerous because of the monsters and complex
because of the maze-like interior of the Skyscraper.
	Enter the Skyscraper and travel clockwise to the door in the NW corner.
When you pass through it, you will be standing in a sort of "transporter room."
Step to the E off of the platform and you will be transported to another one.
Head N into the next area of the building.  Head S a bit and position yourself
in the small niche in the E wall.  The niche is equal to what I will refer to in
as the followinf directions as one "block" of space.  Note that the next few
areas can be very frustrating to travel through because the paths are hidden;
you must "feel" your way through the walls and be prepared to backtrack a lot if
you don't map carefully.
	Head E beyond the niche for 4 blocks;head N until
you enter the W-E hall.  Move E along the S wall for 5 blocks and head S through
the wall for 5 blocks.  Move E until you enter the N-S hall; head S as far as
you can go.  Head W until you are blocked, S into the W-E hall, then E until a
door appears.  Go through the door into another transporter; step E to travel to
the next platform, then N to exit the transporter.
	Head E to the seconN corridor; travel N to the 4-way intersection and 
turn E.  Go E until you reach the wall, then head N toenter a long W-E corridor.
Travel E to the end of the corridor, then S through the door.  The spiked floors
of this room will damage you, so your best bet is to travel directly to the pair
of doors you will see when you enter the room.  Enter the W door to the next 
transporter room and step W to transport.
	Here's how to get through this "lights out" room:  Head S to the wall,
then turn E and move 5 blocks.  Head N until you are blocked, then W until you
are blocked.  Move 3 blocks N, then turn and travel W until you are below the
NW door.  Now head N and through the door to the next transporter; step W to
transport.
	Head E to the wall and follow the wall S for 4 more blocks; turn E and
step through the wall  to gain access to the door in the N wall.  In this room,
you will find an Elixir, just in case you need it.  Exit the room and head W 
back through the wall.  Travel S through the short corridor, then turn E and
enter the first door to go directly to the next transporter; step W.
	Head E to the perimeter of the building and travel clockwise to the
W-E corridor in the center of the W side of the building.  Head E down the
corridor and you will find a stairway which takes you to the subway platform
where Su-Zaku awaits you.  Head S, W, then N to the subway train.  Head E until
you reach the open door which allows you to enter the train.  You will encounter
two passengers as you work your way E through the subway cars.  The man is safe
to talk to, but the seated woman is actually an Evil Eye.
	At the end of the train, you will find the kinapped Sayaka.  A Guard
will take her away, but you will follow . . . directly into a battle with
Su-Zaku!  The first thing you must do is use the Erase 99; after that, it's up
to you.  I'd suggest avoiding spells; a Rune Sword for each of the HMs with a
Light Saber and a Vampic Sword for the MFs will do the job.
	After defeating Su-Zaku, you will spend a sad moment with Sayaka at
So-Cho's grave.  However, she gives you the next Sphere.  Head down the stairs
in the SE corner and you'll appear in front of the Tower.  You can leave Ruins
now, but you might want to head back to Southwest Town first.  With Su-Zaku
defeated, the shops are open again--one last chance to increase your stats and
upgrade your equipment before heading off to face even greater enemies than
the four Fiends.  If you need cash, you can wander the surface of Ruins in
search of monsters to defeat; you can still use a bike, but note that the subway
tunnels are now sealed.  Also, trash the Erase 99; it is useless and cannot be
sold.  When you're all refreshed and equipped, head back to the Tower.

14. The Tower
	With the destruction of Su-Zaku, you have now defeated the four fiends
and can continue further up the Tower in search of Ashura, the mysterious arch-
fiend you have been told about have not yet seen.  If you think you're ready to
confront him, travel clockwise after entering the Tower until you reach the
S area of 16F.  Here you will find the next sealed door, but you must travel
some damaging spikes to get to it; use the Red Sphere to open it.

Intermediary Floors: 17-22
	Stair 16:	No item.
	17F:		Head E to the second stairway; climb the stairs along
			the E edge of the Tower to reach the next door.
	Stair 17:	The chest contains a Door.  This is a very important
			item!  Make sure to pick it up and use it SPARINGLY,
			since you only get three uses.  The Door allows you to
			teleport to any of the floors you have visited.
	18F:		Head counterclockwise to the door in the SW area of this
			floor.  Talk to the "busy worker," then head down the E
			escalator and talk to the folks you meet at the bottom.
			To get back up, take the W escalator.  The Healing Pool
			in the spiked area is fake, so to avoid damage, head
			clockwise around the floor to the SE door.
	Stair 18:	The chest contains a Magnum.
	19F:		Head N, then follow the hallway W to a "two-way" 
			escalator.  Go down the E side, then take a quick detour
			E and N to find a working Healing Pool.  Now head back
			to the bottom of the escalator and continue W, then N to
			a door.  Beyond the door you will find a grim, tragic
			scene; head down the stairs in the SE corner to find the
			explanation.  Note that the Creator seems to have not
			done a very good job of "looking after the children."
			Use the W side of the escalator, then head back E; this
			time, use the door to the N at the top of the short
			stair.
	Stair 19:	The chest contains the Aezis Shield.  
			Note:  When I tried to pick up this item, I was informed
			that I was "overloaded" when I knew that I still had
			an open item slot--or, rather, I knew I had more than
			one open slot before I picked up the Magnum.  When I
			checked my Item menu, I found I had also reveived a
			Nuclear Bomb; however, I don't know when I received it! 
			It may have been added to my Item menu when I searched
			19F, but I was not informed of it by the game.  If
			anyone can verify where it came from, please contact me 
			(I'll find out next time I play the game, but I don't
			want to wait that long ;) ).
	20F:		Head W, then S past the Healing Pool (another fake).
			Enter the door to the W and you will find a small
			library.  Carefully search each shelf for a "teaser"
			about Ashura.  The 7th shelf to the E is a secret door
			through which you will find the powerful spell, Flare.
			Travel back to the E door to continue up the Tower.
	Stair 20:	No item.
	21F:		Travel counterclockwise to find a working Healing Pool.
			Now head back to the door and follow the corridor to the
			N.  Before entering the door, make sure you have a
			slot open in your item menu!  Dump something marginally
			useful if you must, since you are about to receive a
			very powerful item.  Once through the door, head W to
			vertical "path" without flowers; head S to the 11th row

	Stair 21:	The chest contains the Glass Sword.  Each time you use

	22F:		Head E to the central column and follow it S to the

Ashura
	At this point, you will notice that there is no door; however,
the column does bear one of the winged insignias that have denoted important
doors on previous floors.  Stand in the center of the S end of the column and
step N.  You will be carried up the column and onto a series of stairways
leading to Ashura.  You will NOT be able to turn around and go back.  At this
point, the door becomes very important, since it is your only means of visiting
the previous floors in order to pick up any important weapons, spells, or other
items which you need but might have missed or used up (like two specific swords,
for example . . . hint-hint-nudge-nudge).  Before you enter this phase of the
Tower, it's a good idea to use Cure or Rod on as many of your party members
who need it and to make sure that one of your FMs is equipped with one of
those curative items.  You'll probably need it.
	As you head up the stairs, you will be assaulted by some of the most
powerful creatures in the game.  Run away whenever possible, but bear in mind
that if you cannot run, your enemies will strike first!  This can be very fatal
when facing Wights (use Book) and Troopers (make sure someone can use the Aezis
Shield).
	You will find Ashura blocking your path to a stairway at the end of a
hall.  He is, however, a bit tricky to confront.  Ashura stands near the E side 
of the hallway and can only be approached from the E or W sides of the hall; if
you head straight up the middle of the hall, you will be teleported back to the
door at the base of the column.  The easiest way to set yourself up for this
confrontation is to hug the E side of the stairways and hallways as soon as you
encounter pathways which are wider than a single block.
	Although he's a bit challenging to reach, Ashura is not terribly
difficult to beat, provided you have the right weaponry and other items.  Your
HMs should be equipped with swords; Excalibur and the Glass Sword will work,
but you might want to save them for later.  My sword of choice is the Rune
Sword; although it doesn't deal as much damage as some others, it has the
valuable added ability of being able to counter and reflect spells cast by your
opponent.  One of your FMs should have the Aezis shield and the other should be
equipped with a P-Sword or Laser Saber and a curative item like the Rod.  Use 
the Aezis during every round of the battle to prevent as much damage as possible
and have the other FM alternate between using a weapon a curative item as 
needed; keep battering away with the HMs, and Ashura will be toast in no time.

Don't Ya' Hate When That Happens?
	So . . . you defeat Ashura and run up the stairs.  And what happens?
You fall down a hole and end up . . . (insert drumroll here) . . .  back in
Base Town!  Things are a bit different, though.  All of the friends you have 
made who have actually survived the adventure will be there to greet you and
tell you what's new in their lives.  As well, you will once again meet the "Guy
With the Hat," who will tell you that a path to Paradise awaits you in the
Tower.  So now you get to start all over, right?
	Well, not quite.  When you re-enter the Tower through the door in Base
Town, you will find that you no longer travel within the Tower but, rather,
climb a series of stairways on the outside of it.  The trip to the top is, thus,
much shorter, but you have the added bonus of getting to fight the four fiends
again as you climb--and they're all a bit nastier, now.  Luckily, you have a few
oportunities to prepare for the trip.
	First of all, you will discover that the shops in Base Town now sell
much more powerful weapons, armor, and other items.  However, chances are you
won't have enough GP for many of them.  Luckily, you can use the Door to 
teleport to the inside of the Tower and travel the various floors and worlds at
your leisure until you have gather as much GP and miscellaneous items as you
feel you need.
	At this point, I recommend dumping or selling as many extraneous items
as you can.  Keep Excalibur and the Glass Sword, but open up as many slots as
you can. Use the door to return to Ocean (5F), where you can equip your HMs with
Axes and your FMs with Elec Spells.  Once prepared, head back to the Undersea
Castle and pummel Atom Crabs until you've amassed a hefty fortune (if you take
this suggestion, make sure you recover the Red Orb from the Orb Room again,
otherwise you will not be able to leave the caves beneath the sea).  At this
point, the floors of the Tower are all open to you; if you want to have some fun
and make some cash, try climbing all the way to the top again and checking the
various floors and worlds for items you may have missed; when you get to the
top, you can either use the Door or hop into the pit again to return to Base
Town.  No matter what you choose to do, your overall goals are the same:  Make
money, return to Base Town, power-up as much as you can, then re-enter the Tower
to solve the mystery of Paradise once and for all.

Paradise by the GameBoy Light
	And what exactly is the secret to Paradise?
	Hmph . . . now, do you really expect me to ruin the ending for you?
	C'mon, people!  You're almost there!  You're less than a half-hour
away from completing the game.  You'll just have to make it to Paradise on your
own.
	However . . . if you are at the end and having difficulty with the final
"event," just drop me a post with your question(s); I'll try to answer them
personally, but I will definitely include the most frequently-asked questions
in a brief article in issue #3 of TGSSZ.  As well, if you have questions on the
specific use and/or capabilities of the many weapons, armor, and/or items in
the game, I can answer them, as well as any questions about the nature of the
special abilities of the Mutants.
	Good luck!
