Terms of Impairment, Part 1: RPGs

	Back in June, when I started writing for _Encrypt_ and planning the
launch of this 'zine, I found myself thinking a lot about words.  Now, that's
nothing new or different for me, since thinking about words is, basically, how
I make a living.  But what I started thinking about, in particular, were the
words we use to classify and categorize videogames--words like shooters,
flight sims, vertically-scrolling, first-person perspective, 3D, strategy games,
platform games, action games, and many others.
	The operative word there is "many."  Take a breeze through the gaming
mags out there and pay attention to their classification systems (if they have 
them) and their categorical terms.  Now look at the various gaming lists . . .
now look at videogame ads . . . and the box-copy on the games themselves.  Is it
just my imagination, or does there seem to be a lot of inconsistency and over-
lap?
	For the average gamer, this might not be too big a deal.  But for those
of us trying to write about games, I think it's getting harder and harder to
conveniently slot games and describe them in a few words.  It seems to me that
this is a result of the increased ability of game designers to produce more
complex games with more varied types of play style, control, perspective, etc.,
and shows that many of the terms we use to describe and categorize videogames
come from those bygone days when the games were smaller and simpler.
	Take the term "shooter," for example.  Think of a true classic example
of this term.  Space Invaders comes to mind, for me; you basically move back
and forth at the bottom of a screen and shoot at advancing waves of enemies.
Galaxian added fancy colors and swooping enemies, but kept the basic idea.  Now
how about something like Xevious?  Now you have a scrolling shooter; compared
to Gradius, Xevious would be a vertically-scrolling shooter, whereas Gradius is
a horizontally-scrolling shooter.  And then there's Lifeforce, which is a
vertically- and horizontally-scrolling shooter.  And then there's CosmoTank,
which could be described as an overhead- and 3D-perspective shooter with
vertically-scrolling mid-stages.  But then again, maybe CosmoTank isn't a
shooter at all, but an action game . . . or should I say "adventure" game . . .
or maybe it's an action/adventure tank-sim shooter . . . ?
	See what I mean?
	Anyway, I'll be dealing  with shooters in a future issue.  There's
another word--an acronym, actually--relevant to this month's issue: RGPs.
	"Role-Playing Games."  We've all heard of them; many of us have played
them.  But . . . what exactly IS a role-paying game?  In various gaming mags,
I've seen the "RPG" applied to a number of games to which I would never have
considered applying the term.  But there is a reason for my personal biases
with respect to what is and isn't an RPG, and this comes from my past experience
with the games from which the term was derived--games that don't involve a
cartridges, consoles or a television.  I'm referring, of course, to dice-based
role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Runequest, and tons of others.
These are the games which gave RPG a permanent place in our vocabulary of pop
culture, and these are the games to which videogame programmers looked in order
to determine the basic characteristics of the RPG.
	But before I get into those characteristics, I want to take you through
the mental obstacle course which prompted me to write this.  As I mentioned
earlier, planning this 'zine required me to make a determined effort to come
up with some consistent classification system which I could use to talk about
games.  Since I'm most involved with Nintendo systems and games, I figured the 
best place to start would be at the source.  At first, that seemed like a
pretty good idea.  Right.
	By the time the GameBoy was firmly entrenched as a part of the videogame
industry, Nintendo had put into place a simple 7-term classification system for
its games:  1) Action
	    2) Adventure
	    3) Quiz/Productivity
	    4) Puzzle
	    5) RPG
	    6) Sports
	    7) Strategy
The place where you can best see this system in action is in back-issues of
_Nintendo Power_.
	According to that system, the following first- and second-generation
GB games are among those classified as RPGs (there are others):
	Final Fantasy Legend
	Final Fantasy Legend II
	Sword of Hope
	Ultima: Runes of Virtue.
For the first two games on the list, the RPG designation fits perfectly,
particularly when we look at the roots of the RGP classification.  Dice-based
RPGs traditionally begin with the creation of a party of adventurers based on
a combination of choice (race, gender, name, alignment, profession, etc.) and
chance (rolls of the dice for character stats).  The element of choice has 
definitely been provided in FFL and FFL2, and, although starting stats are
somewhat fixed, both choice and chance combine in development/advancement of
the party members.  In dice-based RPGs, the Dungeon Master, Game Master, or
whatever monitors and, in some cases, guides the party's progress through a
quest which, while it contains a number of goals which must be accomplished,
can proceed along a multitude of variant paths depending on decisions made by
the party members.  Such is the case with FFL and FFL2, though the Dungeon
Master has been replaced by a computer program.  In both the FFL series and
dice-based RPGs, the characters accumulate money (GP) and/or experience (EP)
which allow them to purchase items to aid them in their quest and replenish/-
increase their character's abilities.  They talk to and are somtimes accompanied
by non-player characters (NPCs) and encounter a variety of nasty enemies to
defeat, riddles/puzzles to solve, and obstacles to overcome.
	Sword of Hope varies from this description of the RPG in a number of
ways; however, it has retained far more of the characteristics of the classic.
RPG.  Most noteably, there is only one adventurer, rather than a party of four
or more; as well, everything about that adventurer is predetermined, removing
most of the initial opportunity for choice.  However, this difference is far
more useful in making a distinction between dice-based RPGS and RPG videogames
than in drawing a line between RPGs and some other class of game.  As the Dragon
Warrior series clearly shows, the one-player RPG is an established part of the
Nintendo videogame library; in fact, aside from the FFL series, most other 
widely-released GB RPGs are one-player adventures, such as Knight's Quest, 
Great Greed, and Sword of Hope 2.  However, it's with one-player RPGs that the
classification problems really begin.
	Like Sword of Hope, Ultima: Runes of Virtue is a one-player adventure
(well, the 1991 version was; the 1992 upgrade complicates things even further,
or perhaps it just makes them more clear . . .).  But is it really an RPG?
According to NoA, at least in 1991, it is; however, I think that labelling U:RV
an RPG had much more to do with the Ultima name than with the actual game.  As
with FFL and Sword of Hope, U:RV is derived from an NES game.  As with Sword of
Hope, that NES game was derived from a computer game.  Both the computer and
NES ancestors of U:RV are classic examples of the traditional RPG, and it is,
perhaps, on that basis that NoA chose to label the GB adaptation an RPG, as
well.  And I suppose that the NES Godzilla and GB Godzilla are the same game,
too; just like the NES Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Bill & Ted's
Excellent GameBoy Adventure are also the same type of game.  It seems to me
that U:RV has much more in common with Gauntlet II, Solomon's Club, and even
Boxxle than with the NES Ultima series.  I would not include U:RV in the same
category as FFL, FFL2, or SoH.  My preference would be to group it with games
like Rolan's Curse, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Spud's Adventure
(which features a two-player mode similar to the one added to U:RV in 1992).
	Well . . . what did I just say?  LA is not an RPG?  That's right.  It's
kind of hard to imagine that a game as large and complex as LA is not an RPG,
but that's the way it is.  LA is no more an RPG than Metroid II: The Return of
Samus, although it has much more depth.  But why not?  I've already said that
one-player adventures could be RPGs.  I've already said that RPGs involved 
vast quests with a lot of opportunity for non-linear exploration.  I've already
said that RPGs involve talking and travelling with NPCs, buying items and
stuff . . . .  So what's the big distinction?
	In my opinion, it's a distinction that can be seen in an aspect of the
play-style of U:RV.  However, it is not nearly as pronounced in U:RV as it is
in LA, or RC, or GII.  In U:RV, your reflexes is almost as important as using
your brain.  Although, as in any true RPG, U:RV requires a lot of careful
thought and problem/puzzle-solving skills, your character is operating in 
"real time," as is shown in the interaction with objects and enemies.  This has
never really been a characteristic of the RPG, and you can go as far back as
dice-based RPGs to see this borne out.  In games like AD&D and RuneQuest, using
your mind is primary; using your hands is not.  You don't even have to roll
your own dice if you don't want to; some games give this responsibility to the
Game Master.  But you are still responsible for making your own decisions and
thinking your way through situations.  We might say, then, that the distance
between RPGs and what I'll call, for now, Action/Adventure games is a function
of the amount of hands-on fighting vs. brain-on thinking that you have to do.
	But having said that, I have to take you back to something I said much
earlier:  How we categorize and classify games seems to have to shift and
change over time as a result of the ever-increasing abilities of game-designers
to produce more varied, complex types of games.  With that in mind, let me say
three words: Final Fantasy Adventure.
	Is it an RPG?  An Action/Adventure game?  Or something entirely new?
How would you categorize this game, and why?  Let me know what you think, and
I'll publish your reactions and opinions when I return to "Terms of Impairment"
in a future issue.
	But not next issue.
	My brain hurts.

Yours truly,
Jack the skRipper
