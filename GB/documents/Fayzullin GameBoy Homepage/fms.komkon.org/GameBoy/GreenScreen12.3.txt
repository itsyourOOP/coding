LEVEL TWO


Legends in Our Own Time: A Final Fantasy Review Special

FINAL FANTASY LEGEND
	Even though this game is almost as old as the GameBoy itself, it
remains one of the best RPGs for the system.  As well, it is the first entry
in the GB's most popular RPG series--the only GB RPG series which involves
multi-member parties custom-made by you.  FFL takes the best features of the
original NES Final Fantasy, improves them, and shrinks the package down to GB
size.  In fact, FFL is in some ways a bigger, better game than FF!  FFL involves
the exploration of four increasingly large and complex worlds which you discover
as you climb the 20+ floors of a massive, monster-filled tower.  Your primary
task is to prove, or disprove, the existence of the mythical Paradise which is
supposedly located at the top of the mysterious Tower; however, to climb the
Tower you must complete four sub-quests, each centering on obtaining one of four
spheres which unlock certain doors in the Tower.  Each sub-quest contains a
number of smaller tasks, resulting in a very entertaining RPG.  The graphics,
play options, and size of the quest make FFL a very impressive first-generation
GB cart.  Best of all, the flexibility offered in generating and developing your
party allows for near-infinite replay value; there's always something new to
try!  If you don't believe me, ask any of the gamers out there on the Net who
are STILL playing and enjoying this excellent RPG!  *80*

FINAL FANTASY LEGEND II
	A gap of almost two years sits between the release of FFL and FFL2;
however, FFL2 is proof that Square Soft filled that gap will a lot of hard
work and thoughtful game-design.  FFL2 corrects all of the flaws of FFL and
improves on all of FFL's best features.  Once again, you create a party of
four adventurers; however, this time around, you have a new character-type,
the Robot, and will also be joined from time to time by non-player characters
(NPCs) over whom you can exert a certain measure of control; each of the NPCs
has his/her own agenda, however, and they will leave the party when their
task is complete.  Your primary goal is to search for your long-lost father,
who left home years ago to search for the 77 Magi crystals which had been
scattered throughout the nine "great worlds" of this game's universe.  As you
carry out your search, you will face a number of unique and intriguing
sub-tasks, including a "Fantastic Voyage"-style journey through the bloodstream
of another character!  In nearly all aspects, FFL2 is an improvement on FFL--
the quest is bigger, the graphics and animation are better, character control
is enhanced, and more.  Surprisingly, my only real problem with this game is
that individual characters cannot die!  When an individual character's HP are
reduced to 0, that character "faints" and is revived, with only 1 HP, if the
party wins the battle; however, if your entire party is defeated in a battle,
the game ends--although you are given a very interesting option for continuing.
You can ask Odin to resurrect your defeated party, but the price is that you
must agree to fight him later on . . . and the more often you must resurrect
your party, the tougher he is in that fight!  It's these kind of unique twists
that make FFL2 a superior entry in the Final Fantasy series.  *96*

FINAL FANTASY ADVENTURE
	FFA is one of those hard-to-peg games that blurs the boundary between
Action/Adventure games and RPGs.  It's one of those games that the term
"Action RPG" was meant for.  Whatever you decide to  call it, though, FFA is 
still an excellent game.  All of the trademarks of the GB FF series are here: 
superior graphics and sound, a long and intriguing quest, and well-thought-out
play control (watch that pesky B-button, though; it's awfully easy to 
accidentally waste magic/item uses); in other ways, however, FFL is closer to
some other GB games than to the rest of the FF series.  Although it has some
similarities to the original Gargoyle's Quest and the GB version of Who Framed
Roger Rabbit?, FFA can be most accurately compared to The Legend of Zelda:
Link's Awakening.  Like LA, FFA involves a single-character overhead-perspective
quest in which all the battles take place in "real time."  Unlike LA, however,
as your character advances in level, he receives a certain number of points
which you can distribute across his character attributes as you so choose.  In
addition to buying and discovering various types of items and weapons, he can
also acquire and use magic spells.  Game action takes place on the surface
world, underground, and in various castles and dungeons.  At certain stages of
the game, you are accompanied by one of a number of NPCs, each with some special
skill which they will share at your request.  The NPCs follow your character
around as if attached to him by a bungy cord--just one example of the game's
impressive animation.  FFA is packed with cinema-like sections which advance the
story . . . and what a story it is!  Also, FFA has the most emotionally touching
endings I have seen in a GameBoy game (a helluva lot more rewarding than "And
then he woke up . . .").  Fans of LA will enjoy this game, but I think it will
have a special appeal to Secret of Mana players (nudge-nudge).  *90*

FINAL FANTASY LEGEND III
	With this entry in the FFL series, it seems that Square Soft's reach has
finally exceeded it's grasp.  In comparison with its predecessors, especially
FFL2, FFL3 falls just short of being completely satisfying.  The game promises
much--a time-travelling quest spanning the past, present and future of a world
in peril.  However, the world seems surprisingly small, and I finished FFL3
faster than FFL, FFL2, and even FFA.  The basic problem seems to be that the
programmers packed so many features into the game that they ran out of room
for the actual quest!  The focus of the game is the Talon, a powerful fighter-
craft capable of time-travel.  You must recover the 13 Units necessary to enable
all of the Talon's capabilities in order to defeat a bizarre entity which is
simultaneously destroying your world in three different phases in its history.
Despite its many positive features, FFL3 seems curiously restrictive.  There is
very little you can accomplish without all of the Talon's Units, so you are
"forced" to keep moving forward rather than exploring freely.  As well, your
party members are assigned by the computer in accordance with the game's story 
(though you can change their names); this is fine for advancing the plot (as in 
Final Fantasy II), but it seems a step backward from the initial flexibilty of 
FFL and FFL2.  The addition of two new character-types (Cyborg and Beast) and
the expansion of the unique FFL character-transformation system almost make up 
for FFL3"s "limitations," but these features seem at times to just over-
complicate the game.  Still, FFL3 is an enjoyable addition to the FFL series.
It's certainly not a bad game . . . it's just, well, different.  *80*

LEVEL THREE


GameBoy Game Genie Codes: The Final Fantasy Series

FINAL FANTASY LEGEND
	These codes only affect your start-up character, which MUST be a
	Human Male:
	xx1-238-C4A	Set starting Strength
	xx1-248-E6E	Set starting Defense
	xx1-258-F7A	Set starting Agility
	xx1-268-E6A	Set starting Mana (Yes!  A Human that can use magic!)
	xx2-588-19A	Set starting HP
	NOTE:		To max-out your Strength, Defense, Agility, or Mana,
	set "xx" to "A0."  To max-out your HP, set "xx" to "EF"; if you set
	"xx" at "FF," your HP will be quite high, but your character will
	experience some added "technical dificulties"; for example, you'll be
	able to kill Goblins, but if you encounter a Zombie, your strikes will
	not seem to affect it).  Also, if you save a game with any of the above
	codes  activated, the effects of those codes will be saved and will
	remain in in effect without further use of the Game Genie (nifty!).

FINAL FANTASY LEGEND II
	005-96F-08B
	+ 005-9CF-08B	15,163 HP for all characters (although the display
			will only show 999)
	These codes only affect your start-up character, which MUST be a
	Human Male:
	xx8-E28-086	Set starting HP
	xx8-E48-F72	Set starting Strength
	xx8-E58-F7E	Set starting Agility
	xx8-E68-E66	Set starting Defense
	xx8-E78-E66	Set starting Mana 
	xxE-818-2A2	Set starting number of Longswords (Selling them is a
			quick way to generate some GP!)
	WARNING:	DO NOT attempt to start a previously-saved game when
	using the Game Genie with FFL2!  As well, DO NOT attempt to save a game
	while using the Game Genie with FFL2!  The end-result will be a loss of
	the saved game in Slot #1 of your Save list.
			
FINAL FANTASY ADVENTURE
	FAF-3FC-4C1	Don't take damage (except from poisons and magic)
	Use the following code when you start a game; it cannot be retroactively
	applied to a continued game:
	xxE-6B9-E62	Set starting Stamina, Power and Will (this code is just
			a tad deceptive; you will not receive its full effects
			until you have gained 16 Experience; if you save a game
			with this code activated, the effects of the code will
			be saved and will remain in effect without further use
			of the Game Genie (nifty!)
	WARNING:	Setting "xx" to "FF" (as in FFE-6B9-E62) will, in
	effect, set most of your abilities to 0, although the numbers will not
	indicate this.  You will notice, for example, that it takes forever to 
	beat the creature in the arena in your opening battle . . . since your
	character is actually a super-wimp!  However, once you manage to gain
	16 EP (which is still possible, but challenging), you will be able to
	set ONE of your abilities to its maximum, while the rest start at a
	pitifully low level.  For a maximum character, try EFE-6B9-E62.
 
FINAL FANTASY LEGEND III
	I could not get all of the FFL3 codes which I found on the Game Genie
code-server to work properly, so I decided not to list them until I had done
some tweaking and verified them all.  If you would like to try on your own,
send this message:
	send GameBoy/Final_Fantasy_Legend_III

LEVEL FOUR

 
Adventures in GG Programming #1: Final Fantasy Legend

	Now playing on your GameBoy: "Final Fantasy Dragon Warrior"!!!
	Well, not really.  But what a concept . . . !
	Ya see, the other day I was playing Final Fantasy Legend . . . which I
often do since I have a play-strategy for the game which gives it excellent
replay value.  I like to create "custom" parties and see how far I can get
them through the game.  For example, the manual suggests that you avoid a
party of four mutants, so I took the challenge . . . and completed the game
with a party of four mutants.  At other times, I've created parties in which
certain characters have self-imposed limitations.  For example, one character
might be a pacifist mage who does not fight; that character might only use
defensive and/or healing magic.  Another character might be a martial artist
who does not use firearms or bladed weapons.  The added character classes in
Final Fantasy Legend II allow for even more experimentation; I've tried a
"Star Wars" party made up of a mutant male (Luke), a mutant female (Leia), and
two robots (C3P0 and R2D2), as well as a "Silent Running" party made up of a
human male named Dern and three robots named Huey, Duey and Luey.  No matter
how well you know these games, creating custom parties and setting challenges
gives it almost infinite replay value . . . and I found myself wondering if it
was possible to play FFL like Dragon Warrior.  In other words, how far could I
get with a one-member party?  After trying both a human male and a mutant male,
the answer came fast and hard: Not very far at all, at least not in a reasonable
amount of time.  A one-member party requires immediate trips to a Inn after
every battle, provided the character survives the battle!  If you're willing to
spend a LONG time running back and forth from battle to town to battle to town,
you might be able to finish the first world, but the game's difficulty curve
gets ridiculous with a one-person party.  Since it is not possible to increase a
human's Mana, magic spells are useless, which is a big handicap; using a mutant
is even more troublesome because of the manner in which mutant attributes
change, as well as the fact that a mutant can only carry four items.
	Thanks to the GB Game Genie, though, it is possible to take the one-
player challenge!  Input these three codes and create a Human Male character to
play the game:
		A01-238-C4A
		A01-248-E6E
		A01-268-E6A
Your character will have a 99 Strength, a 99 Defense, and, best of all, a
99 Mana, giving him the ability to use some major magic!  

	[SPOILER ALERT: If you have never played Final Fantasy Legend or have 
not read the walk-through, skip the next paragraph, as it discusses games info
and tasks out of sequence!]

	So . . . what do you do with this awesome character?  Here's some 
strategy suggestions that put an interesting spin on your exploration of the
first world:
	1) Go straight to Castle Sword in the northwest area of the world.  Beat
	King Sword with one blow and get the King Sword.  Equip it, and you will
	have infinite use of a weapon which, thanks to your boosted Strength,
	does at least 400 points of damage per blow!
	2) Now go straight to the Bandit Cave south of Base Town and west of
	South Village.  Beat Bandit with one whack, then head to Castle Armor
	for the King Armor.  You can equip it, but you don't need to since
	nothing in the first world can touch you!
	3) Now that you have the King Sword and King Armor, go to Castle Shield
	and wreak vengeance on the treacherous Steward to get the King Shield.
	4) At this point, you can go to the South Village, return the items
	to the statue and destroy Gen-Bu effortlessly with one swipe of your
	Longsword.  But why hurry?  You've got that impressive sword . . . why
	not use it?
	5) You are effectively invincible, so, as the Bard wrote, it's time to
	"Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!"  Basically, go out and kill
	things and make lots of money.  The best way to do this is to go back
	to Castle Armor, where you find the largest numbers of the most valuable
	enemies, and beat on a Guard repeatedly.  If you want to defeat groups
	of enemies a bit faster, buy a few offensive spells (Fire, Ice, etc.)
	and see what you can do with all that Mana.  Whatever you choose to do,
	remember to buy an Axe or two before you enter the Tower; you can't
	take the King Sword with you, so you might as well equip the most
	powerful weapon available.  I'd also suggest buying a Rod, just in case
	you somehow manage to actually take some damage.

	Taking the one-player challenge not only adds a new dimension to Final
Fantasy Legend, but also provides some useful insight into Game Genie program-
ming.  To get the codes listed above, I began with three FFL codes I found on
the Game Genie Code-server (see LEVEL THREE); these codes only work on your
start-up character, which MUST be a human male:
		011-238-C4A	Start with 1 Strength.
		061-248-E6E	Start with 6 Defense.
		052-588-19A	Start with 5 Hit Points.
It's pretty obvious that altering the first two digits of these codes will
change the value of the relevant attribute; thus, if you don't want to play the
game as Conan the Barbarian, you can adjust the scores accordingly.
	In keeping with my usual method of Game Genie programming, I took the
first code and dropped the last three digits.  After a bit of fiddling around
with the digits 1, 2, and 5, I came up with these:
		A01-258		Start with 99 Agility.
		A01-268		Start with 99 Mana.
However, when I tried using the codes, something I have been suspicious of for
a while was confirmed:  Digits 7, 8, and 9 of any given GB GG code are NOT
always disposable.
	I input the codes as follows:
		A01-238
		A01-248
		A01-268
The relevant abilities all showed as 99, but the game froze up during battles.
I added the "suffix" digits to the first two codes and had some partial success:
		A01-238-C4A
		A01-248-E6E
		A01-268
But it was not complete success.  The Mana code would not work.  The answer: It
needed a suffix to "enable" it.  I tried "C4A" and "E6E," but neither worked,
so I pulled out the little GG codebook and began trying each suffix one by one.
As noted above, "E6A" enabled the Mana code, but I didn't have as much luck with
the Agility code.  After trying about 35 suffixes, I became fed up with the
whole thing and started looking through my code-server print-outs for FFL3
codes.  And that's when I found the update file for FFL which provided the
complete Agility and Mana codes.
	Dontcha hate when that happens?

GAME OVER


I Got Them
Steadily-Depressin'
Low-Down Mind-Messin'
Desktop-Self-publishin' Blues

	Well, for a while there I thought the first issue of TGSSZ was going to
also be the last.  The new academic year crashed in on me and caused a rapid
decrease in my pool of free time.  However, I kept plugging away at the walk-
through, and I have to say that the various requests for TGSSZ that popped up
every-so-often on the 'Net kept me motivated.
	I already have some material ready for the next issue, but I won't make
any promises about what will be in it or when it will come out.  For now, I'll
just say that I'll be publishing the 'zine as a "sporadic bi-monthly," which
means issue #3 will be appearing sometime between November 1 and December 31;
if the e-gods smile upon me, it'll be out by the end of November.
	In the meantime, I hope you all enjoy this issue.  And keep those
"motivational posts" coming in!  I truly welcome all comments on TGGSZ!

Yours truly,
Jack the skRipper
