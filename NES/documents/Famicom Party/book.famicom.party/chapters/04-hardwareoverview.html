        <h1>4. NES Hardware</h1>

        <section>
          <p>
            Before we look at assembly, let's start with an overview of the NES itself.
          </p>

          <h2>The Console</h2>
          <p>
            If you were to open up an NES console and take a look at its insides, you would
            see something like this:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../img/NES-Mk1-Motherboard-Top.jpg">
            <figcaption>An NTSC (US/Japan) NES motherboard. Photo by Evan Amos.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Visually, the NES motherboard is dominated by the cartridge connector at the top
            and two large chips. On the left side is this chip, labelled "RP2A03":
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../img/2a03.jpg">
            <figcaption>The Ricoh 2A03 CPU/APU.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            And on the right side is this other chip, labelled "RP2C02":
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../img/2c02.jpg">
            <figcaption>The Ricoh 2C02 PPU.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Together, these two chips provide all of the NES' processing power. The first chip,
            the 2A03, is the NES' CPU - "central processing unit". The 2A03 is based on
            the MOS Technologies 6502 processor, with a few special tweaks by its producer,
            Ricoh.
            <label for="ricoh-6502-license" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input id="ricoh-6502-license" type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              When I say the 2A03 is "based on" the 6502, there was really only one major difference
              between the two: the 2A03 lacks support for a feature in the 6502 called "binary
              coded decimal" (BCD) mode. BCD allows the binary numbers the CPU works with
              to act like decimal numbers when adding or subtracting. The BCD circuitry in
              the 6502 was covered by a separate licensing agreement that Ricoh was not
              party to, so Ricoh could not legally include BCD mode in its processors
              even though it had full schematics of how the mode was implemented in silicon.
              To get around this issue, Ricoh fabricated a "full" 6502 but cut all electrical
              connections between the BCD portion of the chip and the rest of the processor.
            </span>
            Ricoh also included within the 2A03 a full APU - "audio processing unit"
            - that handles music and sound effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second chip, the 2C02, is the NES' PPU - "picture processing unit" -, what you
            might think of nowadays as a "graphics card". The PPU receives instructions from
            the CPU and translates them into output for the screen. The CPU knows nothing about
            how televisions work; it leaves all of that processing to the PPU.
          </p>

          <h2>Cartridges</h2>
          <p>
            NES games are distributed via plastic cartridges (or "Game Paks", as Nintendo called
            them in the US). Inside each cartridge is a small circuit board that looks something
            like this:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../img/Tetris-Cartridge-Board.jpg">
            <figcaption>The cartridge circuit board for <em>Tetris</em>. Photo by Evan Amos.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Much like the console motherboard, cartridge circuit boards are dominated by two
            large chips. The left-side chip is labelled "PRG", and the right-side chip is labelled "CHR".
            PRG-ROM is "program ROM", and it contains all of the game's code (machine code). CHR-ROM is
            "character ROM", which holds all of the game's graphics data.
            <label for="additional-chips" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input id="additional-chips" type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              There are two additional chips on this board. To the right of the two main ROMs is the "CIC"
              (Checking Integrated Circuit) or <a href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_(Nintendo)">"lockout"</a> chip,
              an attempt to ensure that only Nintendo-produced cartridges would work in an NES. (The CIC chip is also the reason
              why your NES games often flicker repeatedly until you take them out and put them back in,
              hopefully <em>without</em> blowing on the contacts first.) Under the two ROM chips is the "MMC1",
              a memory management controller which we will cover in detail much later in this book.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            These two ROM chips have their pins connected to a series of gold connectors at the edge of the cartridge board.
            When the cartridge is inserted into the console's cartridge slot, the gold connectors make electrical
            contact with an identical set of connectors in the console. The result is that the PRG-ROM is electrically
            wired directly to the 2A03 CPU, and the CHR-ROM is wired directly to the 2C02 PPU.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../img/cartridge-in-console.jpg">
            <figcaption>A diagram showing how the cartridge's ROM chips connect to the console's processors.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h2>What does this have to do with the test project?</h2>
          <p>
            If you look back at the test project's assembly source, you'll notice several lines that start with
            <code>.segment</code>. These are <em>assembler directives</em> - something we'll explore in the
            next chapter - that dictate where in the finished ROM file certain pieces of code should go.
          </p>
          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.segment "HEADER"
.segment "CODE"
.segment "VECTORS"
.segment "CHARS"
.segment "STARTUP"</code></pre>
          <p>
            Two of these segments are not part of the game's code per se.
            The <code>STARTUP</code> segment doesn't actually do anything; it's needed for C code compiled
            down to 6502 assembly, but we won't be using it. The <code>HEADER</code> segment contains
            information for emulators about what kind of chips are present in the cartridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other segments line up to the PRG/CHR split. <code>CODE</code> is, of course,
            the game code that is stored in the PRG-ROM. <code>VECTORS</code> is a way to specify
            code that should appear at the very end of the PRG-ROM block (for reasons we will discuss
            later). And <code>CHARS</code> represents the entire contents of the CHR-ROM, generally
            included as a binary file.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, what are the contents of our CHR-ROM chip, and therefore the graphics that our game will display?
          </p>
          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.segment "CHARS"
.res 8192</code></pre>
          <p>
            <code>.res</code> is another assembler directive that tells the assembler to "reserve" a
            certain amount of blank space - in this case, 8,192 bytes. But if the entire CHR-ROM is
            empty, where does the green background that our test project displays come from?
          </p>

          <h2>Colors and Palettes</h2>
          <p>
            When I said before that the CHR-ROM chip contains "all" of the graphics for our game,
            I was simplifying a bit. To be more precise, the CHR-ROM chip contains <em>patterns</em>
            of different colors to be displayed in the game. The colors themselves, however, are
            part of the PPU itself. The PPU knows how to display a fixed set of 64 colors.
            <label for="color-palette-limits" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="color-palette-limits" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Observant readers may notice that the color palette image here only contains 56 colors,
              not 64. The reason for this is that eight of the 64 colors the PPU knows how to display
              are just black. This is due to a quirk in how NTSC CRT televisions display color,
              not a mistake in designing the hardware.
            </span>
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../img/NES_color_palette.png">
            <figcaption>The NES color palette.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Due to hardware limitations, you can't use all 64 colors at the same time. Instead,
            you assign colors to the system's eight four-color <em>palettes</em>. Four of these
            palettes are used for the "background", and the other four are used for the "foreground".
          </p>
          <p>
            The eight palettes have one additional limitation: the first color of each of the eight
            palettes must be the same. This first color is used as a "default" background color
            (when nothing else is being drawn to the background for a given pixel, the default
            color is used), and it serves as a transparency color for the foreground (foreground
            pixels drawn with the first color act as transparent, allowing the background pixel
            "behind" them to show through). These limitations mean that the NES can display
            a maximum of 25 colors at a time - the one "default" color, and eight palettes
            with three other colors each.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="../img/SMB_palettes.png">
            <figcaption style="margin-bottom:2rem">The eight palettes used in World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. The top four
            palettes are used for the foreground and the bottom four palettes are used for the
            background. Notice that many elements, both foreground and background, are composed
            of the same patterns but different palettes - e.g. the different-colored turtles
            in the foreground and the bush/cloud graphics in the background. The blue first
            color of each palette is the color of the "sky" in the background of World 1-1.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p style="clear:both">
            The PPU refers to each color with a one-byte number. Palette information is
            stored in a specific location of the PPU's memory map (separate RAM that is
            only accessed by the PPU itself). The 32-byte region in PPU memory from <code>$3f00</code>
            to <code>$3f20</code> holds the contents of the eight palettes in sequence. The "default color",
            being the first color of each palette, is stored at <code>$3f00</code>, <code>$3f04</code>,
            <code>$3f08</code>, <code>$3f0c</code>, <code>$3f10</code>, <code>$3f14</code>,
            <code>$3f18</code>, and <code>$3f1c</code>.
            <label for="default-color-repetition" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="default-color-repetition" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              While it is common to repeat the first color for each palette manually,
              technically the PPU only cares about the value written to <code>$3f00</code>. Our
              test program takes advantage of this fact to cut down on the amount of
              code that needs to be written.
            </span>
          </p>

            <figcaption>The NES color palette, overlaid with the byte the PPU uses to
            refer to each color.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>Back to the test project</h2>

          <p>
            Referencing the color chart above, the green background color of our test
            project is <code>$29</code>. If we look back at our test project's code,
            we find this:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="31"><code class="lang-asm6502">LDA #$29</code></pre>

          <p>
            This line of assembly code tells the processor to get ready to use the
            number <code>$29</code>, which corresponds to the green we display in the background.
            We'll look at the details of how this line (and much of the rest of the
            test project's source code) works in the next chapter.
