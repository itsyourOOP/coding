        <h1>6. Headers and Interrupt Vectors</h1>

        <section>
          <p>
            Last chapter, we covered the "main" section of the test project, which sets the background color
            and then goes into an infinite loop. Yet that code only accounts for 13 lines out of the 44-line
            test project source code. In this chapter, we'll explore the remainder of the test project's source
            code and learn a few more opcodes.
          </p>

          <h2>iNES Headers</h2>

          <p>
            At the very beginning of the test project, we see this curious bit of assembly:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.segment "HEADER"
.byte "NES", 26, 2, 1, 0, 0</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code>.segment</code>, since it begins with a period, is an assembler directive - an instruction
            for the assembler to follow when it is converting the code to machine code. <code>.segment</code>,
            as we discussed in Chapter 4, tells the assembler where to put your code in the final output. The
            <code>HEADER</code> segment, unsurprisingly, is placed at the very beginning of the resulting .nes
            file.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second line uses another assembler directive that we've seen before. <code>.byte</code> tells the
            assembler to insert literal data bytes into the output, rather than trying to interpret opcodes
            from them. The string "NES" is inserted as three ASCII codepoints: <code>$4e</code>, <code>$45</code>, <code>$53</code>
            (the ASCII representations of "N", "E", and "S"). The next byte, <code>26</code>, represents the MS-DOS
            "end of file" character (often seen in hex notation as <code>$1a</code>). These four bytes
            are a "magic number" that marks the output as an NES game.
            <label for="magic-numbers" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="magic-numbers" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Most file types have a "magic number" at the start of the file to make it easier for an operating
              system to know what a file is with certainty. Java bytecode files begin with <code>$cafebabe</code>,
              PDF files begin with <code>$25504446</code> ("%PDF"), and zip files begin with <code>$504b</code> ("PK",
              since the format used to be called "PKZIP"). You can find a larger list of file type magic numbers
              on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Format_indicator">Wikipedia</a>.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            The "NES" magic number header specifically identifies the file as an "iNES" NES game.
            <a href="../../external.html?link=http://fms.komkon.org/iNES/">iNES</a> was one of the first NES emulators, and the first to
            achieve widespread popularity. iNES' author, Marat Fayzullin, created a special header format that
            provides the emulator with information about the game itself, such as which region (NTSC/PAL) the
            game is from, how many PRG and CHR ROM banks it has, and more. The full iNES header is 16 bytes long.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our test project's header, after "NES" and <code>$1a</code>, specifies that the "cartridge" for our
            game contains two 16KB PRG-ROM banks (32KB storage) and one 8KB CHR-ROM bank, and that it uses
            "mapper zero". NES cartridges come in many (hundreds) of variations, and the iNES header assigns
            each variant a number. Mapper zero, as you might guess, represents the simplest kind of NES cartridge,
            generally called "NROM". Some of the earliest NES games used NROM cartridges, including <i>Balloon Fight</i>,
            <i>Donkey Kong</i>, and <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>. Due to their relative simplicity, we'll be creating
            NROM cartridge games for most of this book.

            <input type="checkbox" id="ines-header-details" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              For more details on the iNES header format, see the article on the
              <a href="../../external.html?link=http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES">NESDev Wiki</a>. Many of the things that can be
              set through the iNES header, like mirroring modes and PRG-RAM, will be discussed in greater detail
              later in this book.
            </span>
          </p>

          <h2>Isolating Procedures with <code>.proc</code></h2>

          <p>
            After the header, another <code>.segment</code> directive switches us to the "CODE" segment,
            which begins at 16 bytes into the file (i.e., after the 16-byte header). The first thing
            within the segment is a new assembler directive, <code>.proc</code>. This directive lets you
            create new lexical scopes in your code. Basically, this means that the labels you make
            inside of a <code>.proc</code> are unique to that proc. Here's an example:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc foo
  LDA $2002
some_label:
  LDA #$3f
.endproc

.proc bar
  LDA #$29
some_label:
  STA $2007
.endproc</code></pre>

          <p>
            Here, we use the label <code>some_label</code> twice, once in <code>.proc foo</code> and once
            in <code>.proc bar</code>. However, since they are inside of different procs, the two labels
            are treated as totally separate. Using <code>some_label</code> inside of <code>bar</code> will
            refer to <code>bar</code>'s version, and there is no way to access <code>foo</code>'s version
            of the label from inside of <code>bar</code>. Generally, we will wrap independent pieces of
            code in their own procs so they can use the same label names without clobbering each other.
            <label for="why-use-procs" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="why-use-procs" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              This might seem like a lot of effort just to be able to use the same label name in more than
              one place, which is true to an extent. The real power of using <code>.proc</code> comes
              when your code is composed of multiple files - some of which you might not have written
              yourself! Procs let you safely use a label without having to check through all of the
              code to see if you (or another developer) have used the same label before.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            The test project uses four procs - <code>irq_handler</code>, <code>nmi_handler</code>,
            <code>reset_handler</code>, and <code>main</code>. We covered the <code>main</code> proc
            in the last chapter, but what are the other procs doing?
          </p>

          <h2>Interrupt Vectors</h2>

          <p>
            As discussed earlier, the processor in the NES repeatedly fetches and executes bytes
            in sequence. When certain events happen, though, we want to interrupt the processor
            and tell it to do something else. The events that can cause these interruptions are
            called <em>interrupt vectors</em>, and the NES/6502 has three of them:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The <i>reset vector</i> occurs when the system is first turned on, or when the user
              presses the Reset button on the front of the console.</li>
            <li>The <i>NMI vector</i> ("Non-Maskable Interrupt") occurs when the PPU starts preparing
              the next frame of graphics, 60 times per second.</li>
            <li>The <i>IRQ vector</i> ("Interrupt Request") can be triggered by the NES' sound processor
              or from certain types of cartridge hardware.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            When an interrupt is triggered, the processor stops whatever it is doing and executes
            the code specified as the "handler" for that interrupt. A handler is just a collection
            of assembly code that ends with a new opcode: <code>RTI</code>, for "Return from Interrupt".
            Since the test project doesn't need to make use of NMI or IRQ handlers, they consist of
            just <code>RTI</code>:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="5"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc irq_handler
  RTI
.endproc

.proc nmi_handler
  RTI
.endproc</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code>RTI</code> marks the end of an interrupt handler, but how does the processor
            know where the handler for a given interrupt begins? The processor looks to the last
            six bytes of memory - addresses <code>$fffa</code> to <code>$ffff</code> - to find
            the memory address of where each handler begins.
          </p>

          <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table>
              <caption>Interrupt handler lookups</caption>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Memory address</th>
                  <th>Use</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>$fffa-$fffb</code></td>
                  <td>Start of NMI handler</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>$fffc-$fffd</code></td>
                  <td>Start of reset handler</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>$fffe-$ffff</code></td>
                  <td>Start of IRQ handler</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>
            Because these six bytes of memory are so important, ca65 has a specific segment type
            for them: <code>.segment "VECTORS"</code>. The most common way to use this segment
            is to give it a list of three labels, which ca65 will convert to addresses when
            assembling your code. Here is what our test project's "VECTORS" segment looks like:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="39"><code class="lang-asm6502">.segment "VECTORS"
.addr nmi_handler, reset_handler, irq_handler</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code>.addr</code> is a new assembler directive. Given a label, it outputs the memory
            address that corresponds to that label. So, these two lines of assembly set bytes
            <code>$fffa</code> to <code>$ffff</code> of memory to the addresses of the NMI handler,
            reset handler, and IRQ handler - exactly the same order as in the table above. Each
            label on line 40 is the start of the <code>.proc</code> for that handler.
            <label for="turning-it-on" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input id="turning-it-on" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              When the NES first turns on, rather than starting from memory address <code>$0000</code>,
              the 2A03 follows a specific series of steps. It fetches the memory address stored in
              <code>$fffc</code> and <code>$fffd</code> (the address of the start of the reset handler).
              It places that address into the program counter, which makes the start of the reset
              handler the next instruction to be executed. Then it works its way through the reset
              handler, instruction by instruction.
            </span>
          </p>

          <h3>The Reset Handler</h3>

          <p>
            While the test project doesn't make use of the NMI or IRQ events, it does need a reset
            handler. The reset handler's job is to set up the system when it is first turned on,
            and to put it back to that just-turned-on state when the user hits the reset button.
            Here is the test project's reset handler:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="13"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc reset_handler
  SEI
  CLD
  LDX #$00
  STX $2000
  STX $2001
vblankwait:
  BIT $2002
  BPL vblankwait
  JMP main
.endproc</code></pre>

          <p>
            A few things to note about this section of code. First, unlike the other interrupt handlers, it
            does not end in <code>RTI</code> - that's because when the system is first turned on,
            the processor wasn't in the middle of doing anything else, so there is nowhere to "return"
            to. Instead, it ends with <code>JMP main</code>. We saw <code>JMP</code> at the end of <code>main</code>
            last chapter, where <code>JMP forever</code> created our infinite loop. <code>JMP</code>
            stands for "jump", and it tells the processor to go somewhere else to fetch its next instruction.
            The operand for <code>JMP</code> is a full, two-byte memory address, but it is nearly always
            used with a label that the assembler will convert to a memory address at assemble time.
            <code>JMP main</code>, here, tells the processor to start
            executing the code in <code>main</code> once it is done with the reset handler.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, this code features several opcodes we haven't seen before. Let's learn about them by
            analyzing the reset handler line-by-line.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lines 14 and 15 feature two opcodes that are, generally, only found in reset handlers.
            <code>SEI</code> is "Set Interrupt ignore bit". After an <code>SEI</code>, anything
            that would trigger an IRQ event does nothing instead. Our reset handler calls <code>SEI</code>
            before doing anything else because we don't want our code to jump to the IRQ handler
            before it has finished initializing the system. <code>CLD</code> stands for "Clear Decimal mode bit",
            disabling "binary-coded decimal" mode on the 6502.
            <label for="bcd-mode" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="bcd-mode" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Due to convoluted licensing issues surrounding the 6502 and Ricoh's legal ability
              to manufacture it, the 2A03 used in the NES has binary-coded decimal mode circuitry
              within it, but all electrical traces that would connect those circuits to the rest
              of the chip have been cut. <code>CLD</code> (and its counterpart, <code>SED</code>)
              do nothing on the NES as a result, but calling <code>CLD</code> as part of a reset
              handler just-in-case is considered best practice.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            The next three lines go back to familiar loads and stores. We've seen <code>$2001</code> before -
            it's PPUMASK - but <code>$2000</code> is new. This address is commonly referred to as PPUCTRL, and
            it changes the operation of the PPU in ways more complicated than PPUMASK's ability to
            turn rendering on or off. We won't cover PPUCTRL in detail until later in this book, when
            we've seen more of how the NES PPU draws graphics. Like PPUMASK, it is a set of bit fields.
            For the purpose of initializing the NES, the main thing to point out is that bit 7 controls
            whether or not the PPU will trigger an NMI every frame. By storing <code>$00</code> to both
            PPUCTRL and PPUMASK, we turn off NMIs and disable rendering to the screen during startup, to
            ensure that we don't draw random garbage to the screen.
          </p>

          <p>
            The remainder of the reset handler is a loop that waits for the PPU to fully boot up before
            moving on to our main code. The PPU takes about 30,000 CPU cycles to become stable from
            first powering on, so this code repeatedly fetches the PPU's status from PPUSTATUS (<code>$2002</code>)
            until it reports that it is ready. 30,000 cycles sounds like a long time, but the NES' 2A03 processor
            runs at 1.78 MHz, so 30,000 cycles is a tiny, tiny fraction of a second. I'm not going to cover
            <code>BIT</code> or <code>BPL</code> here, but rest assured that we will come back to them later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, with all of our setup complete, we jump to <code>.proc main</code> and execute
            our game's actual code.
          </p>

          <h3>A Full Reset</h3>

          <p>
            The reset handler our test project uses is the most basic handler that will reliably start up
            the NES in a known-good state. There are many other tasks that the reset handler can take
            care of, like setting up the Audio Processing Unit (APU) and clearing out RAM.
            As we add more functionality to our games, we will expand the role of the reset handler as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have now covered all of the code from the test project - congratulations! After the last few
            chapters, you might be thinking to yourself "this is incredibly complicated, why bother?"
            The next chapter is for you!
